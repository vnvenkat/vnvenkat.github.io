@chapter{Catlett:ideas2023,
	abstract = {The notion of a smart city has too often been reduced to the use of technology to automate processes toward more efficiency and cost savings in areas such as transportation, public safety, or energy. These are important objectives to be sure, but the most vexing challenges faced by cities and their inhabitants are less obviously amenable to purely technical solutions, as these relate to human and societal needs such as for opportunity, fairness, safety, and justice. While cities attempt to manage their operations through smart city solutions, no amount of automation or efficiency will automatically make a city ``smart'' if these human and societal needs are not integrated with, or ideally driving, those solutions. Moreover, a focus on technological systems introduces at least two hidden dangers. First, managing complex technological systems requires controlling and monitoring those systems, leading to concepts such as an ``operating system'' for the city and a trend from automation to autonomous systems. This is partly fueled by increasing capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), in turn enabling ever more sophisticated autonomous systems. But operating systems are, predominantly, authoritarian systems and AI capabilities, while extraordinarily useful for many mechanical and mathematical functions, have yet to overcome critical challenges such as bias and judgment, much less understanding human concepts of opportunity or fairness. Second, new technologies introduce new capabilities not yet contemplated by society or governance structures and the potential for derivative capabilities that may not have been anticipated even by the system designers themselves. Thus, these new capabilities operate not only absent appropriate policy but in advance of a clear concept of what those appropriate policies should be! We discuss these challenges in the context of real-world smart city deployments, the impact of such technologies on assumptions about},

	abstract = {Information security within healthcare is paramount and telemedicine applications present unique security challenges. Technology is giving rise to new and advanced telemedicine applications and understanding the security threats to these applications is needed to ensure, among other things, the privacy of patient information. This paper presents a high level analysis of a telemedicine application in order to better understand the security threats to this unique and vulnerable environment. This risk analysis is performed using the concept of threat tables. This case study focuses on the capture and representation of salient security threats in telemedicine. To analyze the security threats to an application, we present a threat modeling framework utilizing a table driven approach. Our analysis reveals that even in a highly controlled environment with static locations, the security risks posed by telemedicine applications are significant, and that using a threat table approach provides an easy-to-use and effective method for managing these threats.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, electric vehicles (EVs) have moved from a niche of the transportation sector to its most innovative, dynamic, and growing sector. The associated EV charging infrastructure is closely following behind. One of the main components of such infrastructure is the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP), which defines the messages exchanged between charging stations and central management systems owned by charging companies. This paper presents OCPPStorm, a tool for testing the security of OCPP implementations. OCPPStorm is designed as a black box testing tool, in order to be able to deal with different implementations, independently of their deployment peculiarities, platforms, or languages used. In particular, OCPPStorm applies fuzzing techniques to the OCPP messages to identify errors in the message management and find vulnerabilities among those errors. It's efficacy is demonstrated through extensive testing on two open-source OCPP systems, revealing its proficiency in uncovering critical security flaws, among which 5 confirmed CVEs and 7 under review. OCPPSTorm's goal is to bolster the methodological approach to OCPP security testing, thereby reinforcing the reliability and safety of the EV charging ecosystem.},

@inproceedings{Xu:icse26,
	abstract = {PHP, a widely-used programming language in Web development, contains powerful dynamic features (e.g., dynamic function name construction), making static detection of taint-style vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting challenging. State-of-the-art static approaches perform call graph-guided backward dataflow tracking, thus failing to analyze those dynamic PHP features like variable functions and control change statements, which results in high false positives and negatives. In this paper, we design and implement CoBrA, a context-, branch-sensitive approach to detect taint-style vulnerabilities in PHP-based Web applications. The key innovations are the abstract domain graph (ADG), which is used to efficiently guide the analysis and ``stretch-relax'' algorithm, which enables accurate resolution of PHP dynamic features and efficient inter-procedural taint propagation. Our evaluation of CoBrA's prototype identified 54 zero-day vulnerabilities in 19 real-world applications with eight Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers assigned, achieved $88.66%$ detection rate with under $0.3%$ false positives on a PHP tarpits dataset, and outperformed four state-of-the-art tools across all test datasets with reasonable time and space consumption.

@inproceedings{Gallingani:most15,
	abstract = {Android's Inter-Component Communication (ICC)
mechanism strongly relies on Intent messages. Unfortunately, due
to the lack of message origin verification in Intents, implementing
security policies based on message sources is hard in practice,
and completely relies on the programmer's skill and attention. In
this paper, we present a framework for automatically detecting
Intent input validation vulnerabilities. We are thus able to
highlight component fragments that expose vulnerable resources
to possible malicious message senders. Most importantly, we
advance the state of the art by developing a method to automatically demonstrate whether the identified vulnerabilities can
be exploited or not, adopting a formal approach to automatically
produce malicious payloads that can trigger dangerous behavior
in vulnerable applications. We therefore eliminate the high rate of
false positives common in previously applied methods. We test our
methods on a representative sample of applications, and we find
that 29 out of 64 tested applications are detected as potentially
vulnerable, while 26 out of 29 can be automatically proven to be
exploitable. Our experiments demonstrate the lack of exhaustive
sanity checks when receiving messages from unknown sources,
and stress the underestimation of this problem in real world
application development.},

emotions, sadness, cognitive mechanisms, concerns related to
work, achievements, leisure and money. Sensitive disclosure is
also found to be a function of the type of reviewer and of the

@article{Narang:jis14,
	abstract = {The distributed and decentralized nature of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has offered a lucrative alternative to bot-masters to build botnets. P2P botnets are not prone to any single point of failure and have been proven to be highly resilient against takedown attempts. Moreover, smarter bots are stealthy in their communication patterns and elude the standard discovery techniques which look for anomalous network or communication behavior. In this paper, we present a methodology to detect P2P botnet traffic and differentiate it from benign P2P traffic in a network. Our approach neither assumes the availability of any `seed' information of bots nor relies on deep packet inspection. It aims to detect the stealthy behavior of P2P botnets. That is, we aim to detect P2P botnets when they lie dormant (to evade detection by intrusion detection systems) or while they perform malicious activities (spamming, password stealing, etc.) in a manner which is not observable to a network administrator.

Our approach PeerSharkPeerShark combines the benefits of flow-based and conversation-based approaches with a two-tier architecture, and addresses the limitations of these approaches. By extracting statistical features from the network traces of P2P applications and botnets, we build supervised machine learning models which can accurately differentiate between benign P2P applications and P2P botnets. PeerSharkPeerShark could also detect unknown P2P botnet traffic with high accuracy.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, operating systems have employed
Discretionary Access Controls (DACs) as their authorization model.
We have implemented a new authorization model called
kernelsec, which provides a much richer set of controls than DACs and thus
provides more refined protections.
In this paper, we describe a programming language-based analysis to
``lift'' the existing application base from the Linux DAC
to the kernelsec authorization model.


The authorization model, which is part of the Operating System (OS) Kernel,
controls a process's external interaction by allowing or denying
operations requested by the process.
In a traditional DAC authorization model,
the user who created an object, such as a file,
is the owner of that object and determines who can access the object.
Unfortunately, DAC models are incapable of
providing strong security properties,
leading to a culture of ``blame the user'' when something goes wrong.

An alternative is to provide
Mandatory Access Controls (MACs)
which can enforce organizational rules
  We note that Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)  and
  SPBAC  can provide either DAC or MAC.
MACs can be integrated with DACs by allowing the user to decide
permissions that are not mandated by the organization.
This paper explores some of the issues in transitioning from a DAC-based
to a MAC-based authorization model and
the role compilers and programming languages can play.

	abstract = {Execution monitoring is a powerful practical technique for enforcement of security policies. In this dissertation, we discuss some of the limitations of existing execution monitoring mechanisms, and develop new techniques that suitably adapt execution monitoring approaches for enforcement of security policies that address confidentiality and integrity of information. In situations where enforcement of policies that address confidentiality and integrity requirements could be directly specified in terms of resource access operations, our execution monitoring approach supports a richer class of access control policies (that support notions such as access history and resource accounting). However, there may exist situations where such requirements cannot simply be addressed by access control. We present two such scenarios and discuss enforcement techniques for these scenarios. The first scenario is one that involves execution of a faulty program (e.g., a freeware file compression utility) or an untrusted program, operating on system or application data. In this case, access control or conventional execution monitoring techniques do not work, as they typically disallow execution any such operations (e.g., modifications to such files) in the first place. We present a solution that is based on program isolation, that works by isolating the effects of the faulty/untrusted program execution from the rest of the system. The second scenario relates data and control flow errors in a program that operates on sensitive data, resulting in loss of data confidentiality. Here too, it is well known that the problem cannot be solved by the use of execution monitors that employ purely runtime monitoring mechanisms. The key idea is to augment execution monitoring mechanisms with information obtained by static analysis of the program. By using a preliminary static analysis to analyze possible information flows in a program, and by combining this analysis with runtime checking techniques, a more precise solution is possible. In all the scenarios mentioned above, we illustrate the approaches that are employed using several practical examples. Finally, we describe a model-based certification mechanism for enforcement of privacy properties.},

	abstract = {The knowledge on attacks contained in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports is very important to effectively identify and quickly respond to cyber threats. However, this knowledge is often embedded in large amounts of text, and therefore difficult to use effectively. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach and tool called Extractor that allows precise automatic extraction of concise attack behaviors from CTI reports. Extractor makes no strong assumptions about the text and is capable of extracting attack behaviors as provenance graphs from unstructured text. We evaluate Extractor using real-world incident reports from various sources as well as reports of DARPA adversarial engagements that involve several attack campaigns on various OS platforms of Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. Our evaluation results show that Extractor can extract concise provenance graphs from CTI reports and show that these graphs can successfully be used by cyber-analytics tools in threat-hunting.

@article{Malik:access20,
	abstract = {All major banks in the USA and around the world offer remote check deposit services. Consumers can use their smart phones to deposit checks remotely. This new online check truncation system is vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, including digital check forgery. Shifting trust from a human teller or an automated teller machine (ATM) to a smart device (cell phone) provides new attack surfaces. This paper exploits security vulnerabilities in the existing remote check deposit system and presents an attack vector for existing remote check truncation systems. The proposed attack vector exploits vulnerabilities in the untrusted client-side check-deposit system that enables an attacker to instrument the check deposit application library. The instrumented library allows the attacker to induce digital check forgery with minimized tampering artifacts. It has been observed through this investigation that digital check forgery-based attacks are more powerful than conventional paper-based check forgery attacks. The effectiveness of these attacks is evaluated by targeting three leading banks in United States, finding that all three of the targeted banks are vulnerable to the proposed attacks. A set of countermeasures based on digital check verification is also proposed to combat digital check forgery attacks on existing remote check deposit systems. The proposed countermeasures rely on tamper detection in digital images and expert-system based decision fusion. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated using tampered check images. The tampered images used for performance evaluation also include set of tampered images used for successfully attacking the remote check deposit systems(being using by leading banks around the world today). Experimental results show that the proposed expert system-based framework is capable of detecting digital check forgery attacks.

	abstract = {Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is being used to search for indicators of attacks that might have compromised an enterprise network for a long time without being discovered. To have a more effective analysis, CTI open standards have incorporated descriptive relationships showing how the indicators or observables are related to each other. However, these relationships are either completely overlooked in information gathering or not used for threat hunting. In this paper, we propose a system, called POIROT, which uses these correlations to uncover the steps of a successful attack campaign. We use kernel audits as a reliable source that covers all causal relations and information flows among system entities and model threat hunting as an inexact graph pattern matching problem. Our technical approach is based on a novel similarity metric which assesses an alignment between a query graph constructed out of CTI correlations and a provenance graph constructed out of kernel audit log records. We evaluate POIROT on publicly released real-world incident reports as well as reports of an adversarial engagement designed by DARPA, including ten distinct attack campaigns against different OS platforms such as Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Our evaluation results show that POIROT is capable of searching inside graphs containing millions of nodes and pinpoint the attacks in a few minutes, and the results serve to illustrate that CTI correlations could be used as robust and reliable artifacts for threat hunting.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present HOLMES, a system that implements a new approach to the detection of Advanced and Persistent Threats (APTs). HOLMES is inspired by several case studies of real-world APTs that highlight some common goals of APT actors. In a nutshell, HOLMES aims to produce a detection signal that indicates the presence of a coordinated set of activities that are part of an APT campaign. One of the main challenges addressed by our approach involves developing a suite of techniques that make the detection signal robust and reliable. At a high-level, the techniques we develop effectively leverage the correlation between suspicious information flows that arise during an attacker campaign. In addition to its detection capability, HOLMES is also able to generate a high-level graph that summarizes the attacker's actions in real-time. This graph can be used by an analyst for an effective cyber response. An evaluation of our approach against some real-world APTs indicates that HOLMES can detect APT campaigns with high precision and low false alarm rate. The compact high-level graphs produced by HOLMES effectively summarizes an ongoing attack campaign and can assist real-time cyber-response operations.

	abstract = {Kernel audit logs are an invaluable source of information in the forensic investigation of a cyber-attack. However, the coarse granularity of dependency information in audit logs leads to the construction of huge attack graphs which contain false or inaccurate dependencies. To overcome this problem, we propose a system, called ProPatrol, which leverages the open compartmentalized design in families of enterprise applications used in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., browser, chat client, email client). To achieve its goal, ProPatrol infers a model for an application's high-level tasks as input-processing compartments using purely the audit log events generated by that application. The main benefit of this approach is that it does not rely on source code or binary instrumentation, but only on a preliminary and general knowledge of an application's architecture to bootstrap the analysis. Our experiments with enterprise-level attacks demonstrate that ProPatrol significantly cuts down the forensic investigation effort and quickly pinpoints the root-cause of attacks. ProPatrol incurs less than 2% runtime overhead on a commodity operating system.

	abstract = {Web-borne malware continues to be a major threat on the Web. At the core of malware infection are for-crime toolkits that exploit vulnerabilities in browsers and their extensions. When a victim host gets infected, the infection dynamics is often buried in benign traffic, which makes the task of inferring malicious behavior a non-trivial exercise. In this paper, we leverage web conversation graph analytics to tap into the rich dynamics of the interaction between a victim and malicious host(s) without the need for analyzing exploit payload. Based on insights derived from infection graph analytics, we formulate the malware detection challenge as a graph-analytics based learning problem. The key insight of our approach is the payload-agnostic abstraction and comprehensive analytics of malware infection dynamics pre-, during-, and post-infection. Our technique leverages 3 years of infection intelligence spanning 9 popular exploit kit families. Our approach is implemented in a tool called DynaMiner and evaluated on infection and benign HTTP traffic. DynaMiner achieves a 97.3% true positive rate with false positive rate of 1.5%. Our forensic and live case studies suggest the effectiveness of comprehensive graph abstraction malware infection. In some instances, DynaMiner detected unknown malware 11 days earlier than existing AV engines.

These vulnerabilities occur when a desired property pertaining to an application's logic does not hold along certain paths in the application's code. Many analysis tools have been developed to find logic vulnerabilities in web applications. Given a web application with logic vulnerabilities, the question is whether one can design methods to patch application code and prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited. We answer this question by developing an approach and tool called LogicPatcher for patching of logic vulnerabilities. We focus on correct patch placement, i.e. identifying the precise location in code where the patch code can be introduced, based on path profiling. As we show in this paper, finding the appropriate location as well as generating the right patch can get complicated and require deep code analysis. We demonstrate the utility of LogicPatcher by automatically fixing several critical parameter tampering and authorization vulnerabilities in large web applications.},

	abstract = {Memory errors such as buffer overruns are notorious security vulnerabilities. There has been considerable interest in having a compiler to ensure the safety of compiled code either through static verification or through instrumented runtime checks. While certifying compilation has shown much promise, it has not been practical, leaving code instrumentation as the next best strategy for compilation. We term such compilers Memory Error Sanitization Compilers (MESCs). MESCs are available as part of GCC, LLVM and MSVC suites. Due to practical limitations, MESCs typically apply instrumentation indiscriminately to every memory access, and are consequently prohibitively expensive and practical to only small code bases. This work proposes a methodology that applies state-of-the-art static analysis techniques to eliminate unnecessary runtime checks, resulting in more efficient and scalable defenses. The methodology was implemented on LLVM's Safecode, Integer Overflow, and Address Sanitizer passes, using static analysis of Frama-C and Codesurfer. The benchmarks demonstrate an improvement in runtime performance that makes incorporation of runtime checks a viable option for defenses.

Although Flash and JavaScript security has been examined extensively, the security of untrusted content that combines both has received considerably less attention.

The severity of these attacks warrants the development of new techniques that address the security of Flash-JavaScript content considered as a whole, in contrast to prior solutions that have examined Flash or JavaScript security individually. Toward this end, the article presents FlashJaX, a cross-platform solution that enforces fine-grained, history-based policies that span both Flash and JavaScript. Using in-lined reference monitoring, FlashJaX safely embeds untrusted JavaScript and Flash content in Web pages without modifying browser clients or using special plug-ins. The architecture of FlashJaX, its design and implementation, and a detailed security analysis are exposited. Experiments with advertisements from popular ad networks demonstrate that FlashJaX is transparent to policy-compliant advertisement content, yet blocks many common attack vectors that exploit the fusion of these Web platforms.},

important developments in modern cybercrime. Much of cybersecurity research in the recent years has been devoted 
towards defending citizens from harm delivered through exploit kits. In
this paper, we examine an alternate, counter-offensive strategy
towards combating cybercrime launched through exploit kits.
Towards this goal, we survey a wide range of 30 real-world
exploit kits and analyze a counter-offensive adversarial model
against the kits and kit operator. Guided by our analysis, we
present a systematic methodology for examining a given kit to
determine where vulnerabilities may reside within its server side implementation. In our experiments, we found over 180
vulnerabilities among 16 exploit kits of those surveyed, and were
able to automatically synthesize exploits for infiltrating 6 of them.
The results validate our hypothesis that exploit kits largely lack
sophistication necessary to resist counter-offensive activities. We
then propose the design of EKHUNTER, a system that is capable
of automatically detecting the presence of exploit vulnerabilities
and deriving laboratory test cases that can compromise both the
integrity of a fielded exploit kit, and even the identity of the kit

	abstract = {Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols have become the security backbone of the Web and Internet today. Many systems including mobile and desktop applications are protected by SSL/TLS protocols against network attacks. However, many vulnerabilities caused by incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs have been uncovered in recent years. Such vulnerabilities, many of which are caused due to poor API design and inexperience of application developers, often lead to confidential data leakage or man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, to guarantee code quality and logic correctness of SSL/TLS applications, we design and implement SSLINT, a scalable, automated, static analysis system for detecting incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs. SSLINT is capable of performing automatic logic verification with high efficiency and good accuracy. To demonstrate it, we apply SSLINT to one of the most popular Linux distributions -- Ubuntu. We find 27 previously unknown SSL/TLS vulnerabilities in Ubuntu applications, most of which are also distributed with other Linux distributions.

@inproceedings{Gjomemo:vmcai15,
	abstract = {Compilers perform a static analysis of a program prior to optimization. The precision of this analysis is limited, however, by strict time budgets for compilation. We explore an alternative, new approach, which links external sound static analysis tools into compilers. One of the key problems to be solved is that of propagating the source-level information gathered by a static analyzer deeper into the optimization pipeline. We propose a method to achieve this, and demonstrate its feasibility through an implementation using the LLVM compiler infrastructure. We show how assertions obtained from the Frama-C source code analysis platform are propagated through LLVM and are then used to substantially improve the effectiveness of several optimizations.

PeerShark, a novel methodology to detect P2P botnet traffic and
differentiate it from benign P2P traffic in a network. Instead of
the traditional 5-tuple `flow-based' detection approach, we use
a 2-tuple `conversation-based' approach which is port-oblivious,
protocol-oblivious and does not require Deep Packet Inspection.
PeerShark could also classify different P2P applications with an
accuracy of more than 95%.},

	abstract = {Parameter tampering attacks are dangerous to a web application whose server fails to replicate the validation of user-supplied data that is performed by the client in web forms. Malicious users who circumvent the client can capitalize on the missing server validation. In this paper, we provide a formal description of parameter tampering vulnerabilities and a high level approach for their detection. We specialize this high level approach to develop complementary detection solutions in two interesting settings: blackbox only analyze client-side code in web forms and whitebox also analyze server-side code that processes submitted web forms. This paper presents interesting challenges encountered in realizing the high level approach for each setting and novel technical contributions that address these challenges. We also contrast utility, difficulties and effectiveness issues in both settings and provide a quantitative comparison of results. Our experiments with real world and open source applications demonstrate that parameter tampering vulnerabilities are prolific total 47 in 9 applications, and their exploitation can have serious consequences including unauthorized transactions, account hijacking and financial losses. We conclude this paper with a discussion on countermeasures for parameter tampering attacks and present a detailed survey of existing defenses and their suitability.},

the problem of detecting whether a given URL is hosted by an exploit kit. Through an extensive analysis of the workflows of about
40 different exploit kits, we develop an approach that uses machine
learning to detect whether a given URL is hosting an exploit kit.
Central to our approach is the design of distinguishing features that
are drawn from the analysis of attack-centric and self-defense behaviors of exploit kits. This design is based on observations drawn
from exploit kits that we installed in a laboratory setting as well as
live exploit kits that were hosted on the Web. We discuss the design and implementation of a system called WEBWINNOW that is
based on this approach. Extensive experiments with real world malicious URLs reveal that WEBWINNOW is highly effective in the
detection of malicious URLs hosted by exploit kits with very low

In contrast to prior approaches that used a delayed or lazy approach to the problem of erasing sensitive data, SWIPE uses a novel eager erasure approach that minimizes the risk of accidental sensitive data leakage. SWIPE achieves this by transforming a legacy C program to include additional instructions that erase sensitive data immediately after its intended use. SWIPE is guided by a highly-scalable static analysis technique that precisely identifies the locations to introduce erase instructions in the original program. The programs transformed using SWIPE enjoy several additional benefits: minimization of leaks that arise due to data dependencies; erasure of sensitive data with minimal developer guidance; and negligible performance overheads.

@inproceedings{Skrupsky:ase12,
	abstract = {The current practice of web application development treats the client and server components of the application as two separate but interacting pieces
of software. Each component is written independently, usually in distinct programming languages
and development platforms --- a process known to
be prone to errors when the client and server share
application logic. When the client and server are
out of sync, an ``impedance mismatch'' occurs, often
leading to software vulnerabilities as demonstrated
by recent work on parameter tampering. This paper
outlines the groundwork for a new software development approach, WAVES, where developers author
the server-side application logic and rely on tools
to automatically synthesize the corresponding clientside application logic. WAVES employs program
analysis techniques to extract a logical specification
from the server, from which it synthesizes client code.
WAVES also synthesizes interactive client interfaces
that include asynchronous callbacks whose performance and coverage rival that of manually written
clients while ensuring no new security vulnerabilities are introduced. The effectiveness of WAVES is
demonstrated and evaluated on three real-world web
applications.},

	abstract = {SQL injection attacks are one of the top-most threats for applications written for the Web. These attacks are launched through specially crafted user inputs, on Web applications that use low-level string operations to construct SQL queries. In this work, we exhibit a novel and powerful scheme for automatically transforming Web applications to render them safe against all SQL injection attacks.
A characteristic diagnostic feature of SQL injection attacks is that they change the intended structure of queries issued. Our technique for detecting SQL injection is to dynamically mine the programmer-intended query structure on any input, and detect attacks by comparing it against the structure of the actual query issued. We propose a simple and novel mechanism, called Candid, for mining programmer intended queries by dynamically evaluating runs over benign candidate inputs. This mechanism is theoretically well founded and is based on inferring intended queries by considering the symbolic query computed on a program run. Our approach has been implemented in a tool called Candid that retrofits Web applications written in Java to defend them against SQL injection attacks. We have also implemented Candid by modifying a Java Virtual Machine, which safeguards applications without requiring retrofitting. We report extensive experimental results that show that our approach performs remarkably well in practice.},

two reasons: to reduce burden on the server and to avoid latencies

@article{Liang:tissec09,
	abstract = {In this article, we present an approach for realizing a safe execution environment (SEE) that enables users to ``try out'' new software (or configuration changes to existing software) without the fear of damaging the system in any manner. A key property of our SEE is that it faithfully reproduces the behavior of applications, as if they were running natively on the underlying (host) operating system. This is accomplished via one-way isolation: processes running within the SEE are given read-access to the environment provided by the host OS, but their write operations are prevented from escaping outside the SEE. As a result, SEE processes cannot impact the behavior of host OS processes, or the integrity of data on the host OS. SEEs support a wide range of tasks, including: study of malicious code, controlled execution of untrusted software, experimentation with software configuration changes, testing of software patches, and so on. It provides a convenient way for users to inspect system changes made within the SEE. If these changes are not accepted, they can be rolled back at the click of a button. Otherwise, the changes can be committed so as to become visible outside the SEE. We provide consistency criteria that ensure semantic consistency of the committed results. We develop two different implementation approaches, one in user-land and the other in the OS kernel, for realizing a safe-execution environment. Our implementation results show that most software, including fairly complex server and client applications, can run successfully within our SEEs. It introduces low performance overheads, typically below 10 percent.

	abstract = {As social networking sites proliferate across the
World Wide Web, complex user-created HTML content
is rapidly becoming the norm rather than the exception.
User-created web content is a notorious vector for
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that target websites
and confidential user data. In this threat climate,
mechanisms that render web applications immune to
XSS attacks have been of recent research interest.
A challenge for these security mechanisms is enabling web applications to accept complex HTML input
from users, while disallowing malicious script content.
This challenge is made difficult by anomalous web
browser behaviors, which are often used as vectors for
successful XSS attacks.

Motivated by this problem, we present a new XSS
defense strategy designed to be effective in widely
deployed existing web browsers, despite anomalous
browser behavior. Our approach seeks to minimize
trust placed on browsers for interpreting untrusted
content. We implemented this approach in a tool called
BLUEPRINT that was integrated with several popular
web applications. We evaluated BLUEPRINT against
a barrage of stress tests that demonstrate strong resistance to attacks, excellent compatibility with web
browsers and reasonable performance overheads.},

In this paper, we describe a verification technique that is designed to check for the satisfaction of this property directly on code from Java standard libraries. We describe a tool CMV that implements this technique and automatically checks shrink-wrapped Java bytecode for the complete mediation property.

@inproceedings{Sun:dimva08,
	abstract = {Software installation provides an attractive entry vector for malware: since
installations are performed with administrator privileges, malware can easily get the enhanced level of access needed to install backdoors, spyware, rootkits, or ``bot'' software,
and to hide these installations from users. Previous research has been focused mainly on
securing the execution phase of untrusted software, while largely ignoring the safety of
installations. Even security-enhanced operating systems such as SELinux and Vista don't
usually impose restrictions during software installs, expecting the system administrator to
``know what she is doing.'' This paper addresses this ``gap in armor'' by securing software
installations. Our technique can support a diversity of package managers and software
installers. It is based on a framework that simplifies the development and enforcement of
policies that govern safety of installations. We present a simple policy that can be used
to prevent untrusted software from modifying any of the files used by benign software
packages, thus blocking the most common mechanism used by malware to ensure that it
is run automatically after each system reboot. While the scope of our technique is limited
to the installation phase, it can be easily combined with approaches for secure execution,
e.g., by ensuring that all future runs of an untrusted package will take place within an
administrator-specified sandbox. Our experimental evaluation has considered over one
hundred benign and untrusted software packages. Our technique was able to block malicious packages among these without breaking non-malicious ones.},

	abstract = {SQL injection attacks are one of the topmost threats for applications written for the Web. These attacks are launched
through specially crafted user input on web applications that
use low level string operations to construct SQL queries. In
this work, we exhibit a novel and powerful scheme for automatically transforming web applications to render them safe
against all SQL injection attacks.
A characteristic diagnostic feature of SQL injection attacks is that they change the intended structure of queries
issued. Our technique for detecting SQL injection is to dynamically mine the programmer-intended query structure
on any input, and to detect attacks by comparing them
against the intended query structure. We propose a simple and novel mechanism, called Candid, for mining programmer intended queries by dynamically evaluating runs
over benign candidate inputs. This mechanism is theoretically well founded and is based on inferring intended queries
by considering the symbolic query computed on a program
run. Our approach has been implemented in a tool called
Candid that retrofits Web applications written in Java to
defend them against SQL injection attacks. We report extensive experimental results that show that our approach
performs remarkably well in practice.},

channel such as a public file or a network connection,
how can we ensure that the data written is free of private

practical setting through the use of a technique that we
call ``data sandboxing'' . Essentially, data sandboxing is
implemented using the popular technique of system call
interposition to mediate output channels used by a program. To distinguish between private and public data,
the program is partitioned into two: one that contains
all the instructions that handle sensitive data and the
other containing the rest of the instructions. This partitioning is performed based on techniques from program
slicing. When run together, these two programs collectively replace the original program. To address confidentiality, these programs are sandboxed with different
system call interposition based policies. We discuss the
design and implementation of a tool that enforces confidentiality policies on C programs using this technique.
We also report our experiences in using our tool over
several programs that handle confidential data.},

	abstract = {Non-interference has become the standard criterion for ensuring confidentiality of sensitive data
in the information flow literature. However, application of non-interference to software systems has
been limited in practice. This is partly due to the imprecision that is inherent in static analyses
that have formed the basis of previous non-interference based techniques. Runtime approaches can be
significantly more accurate than static analysis, and have been more successful in practical systems
that reason about information flow. However, these techniques only reason about explicit information
flows that take place via assignments in a program. Implicit flows that take place without involving
assignments, and can be inferred from the structure and/or semantics of the program, are missed by
runtime techniques. This paper seeks to bridge the gap between the accuracy provided by runtime
techniques and the completeness provided by static analysis techniques. In particular, we develop a
hybrid technique that relies primarily on runtime information-flow tracking, but augments it with static
analysis to reason about implicit flows that arise due to unexecuted paths in a program. We prove that
the resulting technique preserves non-interference.},

The potential for such composite web services can be realized only if consumer privacy concerns are satisfactorily addressed. In this paper, we propose a framework that addresses consumer privacy concerns in the context of highly customizable composite web services. Our approach involves service producers exchanging their terms-of-use with consumers in the form of "models". Our framework provides automated techniques for checking these models at the consumer site for compliance of consumer privacy policies. In the event of a policy violation, our framework supports automatic generation of "obligations" that the consumer generates for the composite service. These obligations are automatically enforced through a dynamic program analysis approach on the web service composition code. We illustrate our approach with the implementation of two example services.},

This is accomplished via one-way isolation: processes running within the SEE are given read-access to the environment provided by the host OS, but their write operations are prevented from escaping outside the SEE. As a result, SEE processes cannot impact the behavior of host OS processes, or the integrity of data on the host OS. Our SEE supports a wide range of tasks, including: study of malicious code, controlled execution of untrusted software, experimentation with software configuration changes, testing of software patches, and so on. It provides a convenient way for users to inspect system changes made within the SEE. If the user does not accept these changes, they can be rolled back at the click of a button. Otherwise, the changes can be ``committed '' so as to become visible outside the SEE. We provide consistency criteria that ensure semantic consistency of the committed results. We also develop an efficient technique for implementing the commit operation. Our implementation results show that most software, including fairly complex server and client applications, can run successfully within the SEE. The approach introduces low performance overheads, typically below 10%.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach for safe execution of untrusted programs  by isolating their effects fromthe rest of the system. Isolation is achieved by interceptingfile operations made by untrusted processes, and redirecting any change operations to a "modification cachel" thatis invisible to other processes in the system. File read operations performed by the untrusted process are also correspondingly modified, so that the process has a consistentview of system state that incorporates the contents of the filesystem as well as the modification cache. On termination ofthe untrusted process, its user is presented with a concisesummary of the files modified by the process. Additionally,the user can inspect these files using various software utilities (e.g., helper applications to view multimedia files) todetermine if the modifications are acceptable. The user thenhas the option to commit these modifications, or simply discard them. Essentially, our approach provides "play" and"rewind" buttons for running untrusted software. Key benefits of our approach are that it requires no changes to theuntrusted programs (to be isolated) or the underlying operating system; it cannot be subverted by malicious programs;and it achieves these benefits with acceptable runtime overheads. We describe a prototype implementation of this system for Linux called Alcatraz and discuss its performanceand effectiveness.},

	abstract = {The ability to analyze and modify binaries is often very useful from a security viewpoint. Security operations one would like to perform on binaries include the ability to extract models of program behavior and insert inline reference monitors. Unfortunately, the existing manner in which binary code is packaged prevents even the simplest of analyses, such as distinguishing code from data, from succeeding 100 percent of the time. In this paper, we propose SELF, a security-enhanced ELF (Executable and Linking Format), which is simply ELF with an extra section added. The extra section contains information about (among other things) the address, size, and alignment requirements of each code and static data item in the program. This information is somewhat similar to traditional debugging information, but contains additional information specifically needed for binary analysis that debugging information lacks. It is also smaller, compatible with optimization, and less likely to facilitate reverse engineering, which we believe makes it practical for use with commercial software products. SELF approach has three key benefits. First, the information for the extra section is easy for compilers to provide, so little work is required on behalf of compiler vendors. Second, the extra section is ignored by default, so SELF binaries will run perfectly on all systems, including ones not interested in leveraging the extra information. Third, the extra section provides sufficient information to perform many security-related operations on the binary code. We believe SELF to be a practical approach, allowing many security analyses to be performed while not requiring major changes to the existing compiler infrastructure. An application example of the utility of SELF to perform address obfuscation (in which the addresses of all code and data items are randomized to defeat memory-error exploits) is presented.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new approach called model-carrying code (MCC) for safe execution of untrusted code. At the heart of MCC is the idea that untrusted code comes equipped with a concise high-level model of its security-relevant behavior. This model helps bridge the gap between high-level security policies and low-level binary code, thereby enabling analyses which would otherwise be impractical. For instance, users can use a fully automated verification procedure to determine if the code satisfies their security policies. Alternatively, an automated procedure can sift through a catalog of acceptable policies to identify one that is compatible with the model. Once a suitable policy is selected, MCC guarantees that the policy will not be violated by the code. Unlike previous approaches, the MCC framework enables code producers and consumers to collaborate in order to achieve safety. Moreover, it provides support for policy selection as well as enforcement. Finally, MCC makes no assumptions regarding the inherent risks associated with untrusted code. It simply provides the tools that enable a consumer to make informed decisions about the risk that he/she is willing to tolerate so as to benefit from the functionality offered by an untrusted application.},

	abstract = {Existing approaches for mobile code security tend to take a conservative view that mobile code is inherently risky, and hence focus on confining it. Such confinement is usually achieved using access control policies that restrict mobile code from taking any action that can potentially be used to harm the host system. While such policies can be helpful in keeping "bad applets" in check, they preclude a large number of useful applets. We therefore take an alternative view of mobile code security, one that is focused on empowering mobile code rather than disabling it. We propose an approach wherein highly expressive security policies provide the basis for such empowerment, while greatly mitigating the risks posed to the host system by such code. Our policies are represented as extended finite state automata, (a generalization of the finite-state automata to permit the use of variables) that can enforce these policies efficiently. We have built a prototype implementation of our approach for Java. Our implementation is based on rewriting Java byte code so that security-relevant events are intercepted and forwarded to the policy enforcement automata before they are executed. Early experimental results indicate that such expressive, enabling policies can be supported with low overheads.},

	abstract = {The persistent and stealthy nature of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) poses a significant challenge to enterprise security. Traditional detection mechanisms often fall short in identifying coordinated multi-step attacks or leveraging the rich context available in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).     The three works presented tackle this problem from complementary angles -- real-time detection, correlation-based threat hunting, and automated intelligence extraction. A unifying thread across these three works is their shared reliance on provenance graphs as a powerful abstraction for capturing and reasoning about complex attacker behavior. Together, these approaches form a complementary ecosystem: Extractor extracts threat knowledge, POIROT hunts for manifestations of that knowledge, and HOLMES detects emergent threats in real-time, all grounded in a common graph-based representation of system activity and threat behavior.    HOLMES introduces a real-time detection framework aimed at identifying the coordinated activities typical of APT campaigns.  It does so by correlating suspicious information flows to generate a robust detection signal and constructing high-level provenance graphs that summarize attacker behavior for analyst response. Its evaluation shows high precision and low false alarm rates, supporting its applicability in live operational environments. POIROT builds on the growing use of CTI standards by actively leveraging the relationships between indicators---often underused in practice---for threat hunting. It treats the problem as a graph pattern matching task, aligning CTI-derived graphs with system-level provenance data obtained from kernel audits. Its novel similarity metric enables efficient search through massive graphs, revealing APT traces within minutes and demonstrating the operational utility of CTI relationship data.    Extractor addresses the challenge of unstructured CTI reports by automatically transforming them into structured, machine-usable provenance graphs. Without requiring strict assumptions about the input text, it extracts concise behavioral indicators that can be fed into threat-hunting tools like POIROT, bridging the gap between raw intelligence and analytical application.    Together, these systems represent a shift toward graph-based, intelligence-driven detection and response. They emphasize the value of integrating real-time monitoring with structured threat intelligence and automation, setting the stage for more adaptive and effective cybersecurity operations.},

The only exception is CodeQL, which supports JSX syntax. However, CodeQL cannot properly track React Data Flow across different components for detecting vulnerabilities.In this paper, we design a novel framework, called ReactAppScan, which constructs a Component Graph (CoG) for tracking React Data Flow and detecting vulnerabilities following both JavaScript and React data flows. Specifically, ReactAppScan relies on abstract interpretation to build such a component graph via tracking component lifecycles and then detects vulnerabilities via finding paths between sources and sinks. Our evaluation shows that ReactAppScan detects 61 zero-day vulnerabilities in real-world React applications. We have responsibly reported all the vulnerabilities and so far six vulnerabilities have been fixed and two have been acknowledged.},

Citar enhances alert investigation by attributing alerts to potential attacker groups and examining audit logs for related attack instances. Utilizing a new correlation analysis developed for this purpose, we identify potential connections between flagged alerts and known attack behaviors present in a system. Citar is evaluated using a DARPA public dataset and 10 new attack scenarios (five real-world APT groups and five popular malwares).

	abstract = {Modern web applications are becoming increasingly complex. They include multiple dynamic runtime constructs that are difficult to analyze by static application security testing (SAST) tools. These tools often use a graph representation of the code for their analysis. However, built statically, such graphs may miss important data and control flows dependent on runtime information. In addition, the presence of difficult-to-analyze code patterns in modern web applications, referred to as testability tarpits, further reduces the accuracy of statically built graphs. As a result, current SAST tools have several false negatives because of 'hidden' paths, which are not present in the graphs. In this paper, we present SemFinder, an approach designed to automatically detect such hidden paths. SemFinder uses natural language semantics to hypothesize connections between different locations in the code based on the meaning and similarity of the variables in those locations and test those hypotheses dynamically. We evaluate SemFinder on 30 PHP applications and discover 215 new exploitable hidden paths with respect to existing SAST tools, leading to the submission of 31 new CVEs.},

	abstract = {Threat Intelligence (TI) serves as a vital component of cybersecurity, empowering organizations to combat cyber threats proactively. While existing research primarily focuses on analyzing threat intelligence feeds from Threat Intelligence Sharing Platforms (TISPs), the extensive data available within TISPs knowledge bases remains largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel approach to perform the first in-depth empirical study of prominent TISPs' databases. To achieve this, we propose an innovative approach to construct a ground truth dataset of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) derived from threat reports. We implement our approach in a tool called TIPCE, which processes over 50,000 threat reports, extracting more than 182K IOCs with high accuracy. TIPCE leverages this dataset to measure and study different features of four known TISP databases, including their coverage, overlap, and timeliness. Our results provide novel longitudinal insights into TISPs, including their distinct performance per IOC type and considerable overlap between TISP databases.},

@inproceedings{Kang:FAST:ieeesp23,
	abstract = {Taint-style vulnerabilities, such as OS command injection and path traversal, are common and severe software weaknesses. There exists an inherent trade-off between analysis scalability and accuracy in detecting such vulnerabilities. On one hand, existing syntax-directed approaches often make compromises in the analysis accuracy on dynamic features like bracket syntax. On the other hand, existing abstract interpretation often faces the issue of state explosion in the abstract domain, thus leading to a scalability problem.In this paper, we present a novel approach, called FAST, to scale the vulnerability discovery of JavaScript packages via a novel abstract interpretation approach that relies on two new techniques, called bottom-up and top-down abstract interpretation. The former abstractly interprets functions based on scopes instead of call sequences to construct dynamic call edges. Then, the latter follows specific control-flow paths and prunes the program to skip statements unrelated to the sink. If an end-to-end data-flow path is found, FAST queries the satisfiability of constraints along the path and verifies the exploitability to reduce human efforts.We implement a prototype of FAST and evaluate it against real-world Node.js packages. We show that FAST is able to find 242 zero-day vulnerabilities in NPM with 21 CVE identifiers being assigned. Our evaluation also shows that FAST can scale to real-world applications such as NodeBB and popular frameworks such as total.js and strapi in finding legacy vulnerabilities that no prior works can.},

An initial visual representation is generated based on the assigned provenance tags to the portion of the data. The initial visual representation is condensed based on a backward traversal of the initial visual representation in identifying a shortest path from a suspect node to an entry point node.

@inproceedings{Ghosh:iciss22,
	abstract = {Modern attacks against enterprises often have multiple targets inside the enterprise network. Due to the large size of these networks and increasingly stealthy attacks, attacker activities spanning multiple hosts are extremely difficult to correlate during a threat-hunting effort. In this paper, we present a method for an efficient cross-host attack correlation across multiple hosts. Unlike previous works, our approach does not require lateral movement detection techniques or host-level modifications. Instead, our approach relies on an observation that attackers have a few strategic mission objectives on every host that they infiltrate, and there exist only a handful of techniques for achieving those objectives. The central idea behind our approach involves comparing (OS agnostic) activities on different hosts and correlating the hosts that display the use of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures. We implement our approach in a tool called Ostinato and successfully evaluate it in threat hunting scenarios involving DARPA-led red team engagements spanning 500 hosts and in another multi-host attack scenario. Ostinato successfully detected 21 additional compromised hosts, which the underlying host-based detection system overlooked in activities spanning multiple days of the attack campaign. Additionally, Ostinato successfully reduced alarms generated from the underlying detection system by more than 90{\%}, thus helping to mitigate the threat alert fatigue problem.},

@inproceedings{Xu:WWW05,
	abstract = {We present a new approach where the
consumers as well as providers can express their privacy concerns in a
 formal way. Specifically, consumers express their requirements in
the form of policies, while providers specify their use of
consumer data using models. Our approach automates compatibility
checking between policies and models. If there is an incompatibility,
the consumer is informed how she can refine her policies in order to use
the service.  If she does not want to change her policies in any way,
the approach passes on additional privacy requirements to the
provider. Service access can continue in case of incompatibilities only if the consumer relaxes her policies, or the provider honors additional consumer privacy
requirements.

The key idea behind our approach is a judicial combination of 
trust (on service providers to accurately specify use of consumer data)
and verification (for compatibility resolution). This combination
enables our approach to support privacy preservation without
requiring access to proprietary code that implements the service.

@inproceedings{Wei:ICCIMA99,
	abstract = {Traditionally, the provided service of Internet transport protocols is reliable/ordered or unreliable/unordered service, respectively. It has been widely accepted that a variety of applications (e.g. multimedia) can tradeoff reliability mechanisms to achieve higher throughput. Such a solution, which additionally respects user preferences for QoS characteristics (e.g. reliability, cost, throughput, delay) is a current demand. We propose an application-oriented transport protocol (AOTP) to handle partially or completely reliable transport service favoring throughput at the expense of reliability, or dropping the reliability level in order to keep the cost at a desired level. The protocol can be applied to cases where resource reservation is not possible or desired. Our approach does not use forward error correction to save bandwidth, but uses instead, a receiver-based retransmission mechanism. Therefore, the protocol is appropriate for applications that tolerate losses and thus, the need for retransmission (additional RTTs) does not arise often. We present encouraging initial results tested over Ethernet links; we compare AOTP with TCP and a TCP-like protocol without congestion control (TCPWCC), contrasting throughput results for different levels of reliability requirements.},
