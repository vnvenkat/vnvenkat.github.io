 abstract = {PHP, a widely-used programming language in Web development, contains powerful dynamic features (e.g., dynamic function name construction), making static detection of taint-style vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting challenging. State-of-the-art static approaches perform call graph-guided backward dataflow tracking, thus failing to analyze those dynamic PHP features like variable functions and control change statements, which results in high false positives and negatives. In this paper, we design and implement CoBrA, a context-, branch-sensitive approach to detect taint-style vulnerabilities in PHP-based Web applications. The key innovations are the abstract domain graph (ADG), which is used to efficiently guide the analysis and ``stretch-relax'' algorithm, which enables accurate resolution of PHP dynamic features and efficient inter-procedural taint propagation. Our evaluation of CoBrA's prototype identified 54 zero-day vulnerabilities in 19 real-world applications with eight Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers assigned, achieved $88.66%$ detection rate with under $0.3%$ false positives on a PHP tarpits dataset, and outperformed four state-of-the-art tools across all test datasets with reasonable time and space consumption.
