abstract: Mixed Flash and JavaScript content has become increasingly prevalent; its
  purveyance of dynamic features unique to each platform has popularized it for myriad
  Web development projects. Although Flash and JavaScript security has been examined
  extensively, the security of untrusted content that combines both has received considerably
  less attention. This article considers this fusion in detail, outlining several
  practical scenarios that threaten the security of Web applications. The severity
  of these attacks warrants the development of new techniques that address the security
  of Flash-JavaScript content considered as a whole, in contrast to prior solutions
  that have examined Flash or JavaScript security individually. Toward this end, the
  article presents FlashJaX, a cross-platform solution that enforces fine-grained,
  history-based policies that span both Flash and JavaScript. Using in-lined reference
  monitoring, FlashJaX safely embeds untrusted JavaScript and Flash content in Web
  pages without modifying browser clients or using special plug-ins. The architecture
  of FlashJaX, its design and implementation, and a detailed security analysis are
  exposited. Experiments with advertisements from popular ad networks demonstrate
  that FlashJaX is transparent to policy-compliant advertisement content, yet blocks
  many common attack vectors that exploit the fusion of these Web platforms.
