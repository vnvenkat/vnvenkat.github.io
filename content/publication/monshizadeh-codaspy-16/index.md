abstract: Logic vulnerabilities are an important class of programming flaws in web
  applications. These vulnerabilities occur when a desired property pertaining to
  an application's logic does not hold along certain paths in the application's code.
  Many analysis tools have been developed to find logic vulnerabilities in web applications.
  Given a web application with logic vulnerabilities, the question is whether one
  can design methods to patch application code and prevent these vulnerabilities from
  being exploited. We answer this question by developing an approach and tool called
  LogicPatcher for patching of logic vulnerabilities. We focus on correct patch placement,
  i.e. identifying the precise location in code where the patch code can be introduced,
  based on path profiling. As we show in this paper, finding the appropriate location
  as well as generating the right patch can get complicated and require deep code
  analysis. We demonstrate the utility of LogicPatcher by automatically fixing several
  critical parameter tampering and authorization vulnerabilities in large web applications.
