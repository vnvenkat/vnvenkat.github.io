abstract: In the last decade, electric vehicles (EVs) have moved from a niche of the
  transportation sector to its most innovative, dynamic, and growing sector. The associated
  EV charging infrastructure is closely following behind. One of the main components
  of such infrastructure is the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP), which defines the
  messages exchanged between charging stations and central management systems owned
  by charging companies. This paper presents OCPPStorm, a tool for testing the security
  of OCPP implementations. OCPPStorm is designed as a black box testing tool, in order
  to be able to deal with different implementations, independently of their deployment
  peculiarities, platforms, or languages used. In particular, OCPPStorm applies fuzzing
  techniques to the OCPP messages to identify errors in the message management and
  find vulnerabilities among those errors. It's efficacy is demonstrated through extensive
  testing on two open-source OCPP systems, revealing its proficiency in uncovering
  critical security flaws, among which 5 confirmed CVEs and 7 under review. OCPPSTorm's
  goal is to bolster the methodological approach to OCPP security testing, thereby
  reinforcing the reliability and safety of the EV charging ecosystem.
