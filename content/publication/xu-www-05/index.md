abstract: We present a new approach where the consumers as well as providers can express
  their privacy concerns in a formal way. Specifically, consumers express their requirements
  in the form of policies, while providers specify their use of consumer data using
  models. Our approach automates compatibility checking between policies and models.
  If there is an incompatibility, the consumer is informed how she can refine her
  policies in order to use the service.  If she does not want to change her policies
  in any way, the approach passes on additional privacy requirements to the provider.
  Service access can continue in case of incompatibilities only if the consumer relaxes
  her policies, or the provider honors additional consumer privacy requirements.  The
  key idea behind our approach is a judicial combination of  trust (on service providers
  to accurately specify use of consumer data) and verification (for compatibility
  resolution). This combination enables our approach to support privacy preservation
  without requiring access to proprietary code that implements the service.
