 abstract = {We present a new approach where the
consumers as well as providers can express their privacy concerns in a
formal way. Specifically, consumers express their requirements in
the form of policies, while providers specify their use of
consumer data using models. Our approach automates compatibility
checking between policies and models. If there is an incompatibility,
the consumer is informed how she can refine her policies in order to use
the service.  If she does not want to change her policies in any way,
the approach passes on additional privacy requirements to the
provider. Service access can continue in case of incompatibilities only if the consumer relaxes her policies, or the provider honors additional consumer privacy
requirements.

The key idea behind our approach is a judicial combination of 
trust (on service providers to accurately specify use of consumer data)
and verification (for compatibility resolution). This combination
enables our approach to support privacy preservation without
requiring access to proprietary code that implements the service.},
