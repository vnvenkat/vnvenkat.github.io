abstract: In this paper we examine the security issues in functionality extension
  mechanisms supported by web browsers. Extensions (or ``plug-ins'') in modern web
  browsers enjoy unlimited power without restraint and thus are attractive vectors
  for malware. To solidify the claim, we take on the role of malware writers looking
  to assume control of a user's browser space. We have taken advantage of the lack
  of security mechanisms for browser extensions and have implemented a piece of malware
  for the popular Firefox web browser, which we call browserSpy, that requires no
  special privileges to be installed. Once installed, browserSpy takes complete control
  of a user's browser space and can observe all the activity performed through the
  browser while being undetectable. We then adopt the role of defenders to discuss
  defense strategies against such malware. Our primary contribution is a mechanism
  that uses code integrity checking techniques to control the extension installation
  and loading process. We also discuss techniques for runtime monitoring of extension
  behavior that provide a foundation for defending threats due to installed extensions.
