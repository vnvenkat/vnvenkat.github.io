 abstract = {When an application reads private / sensitive information and subsequently communicates on an output
channel such as a public file or a network connection,
how can we ensure that the data written is free of private
information? In this paper, we address this question in a
practical setting through the use of a technique that we
call ``data sandboxing'' . Essentially, data sandboxing is
implemented using the popular technique of system call
interposition to mediate output channels used by a program. To distinguish between private and public data,
the program is partitioned into two: one that contains
all the instructions that handle sensitive data and the
other containing the rest of the instructions. This partitioning is performed based on techniques from program
slicing. When run together, these two programs collectively replace the original program. To address confidentiality, these programs are sandboxed with different
system call interposition based policies. We discuss the
design and implementation of a tool that enforces confidentiality policies on C programs using this technique.
We also report our experiences in using our tool over
several programs that handle confidential data.},
