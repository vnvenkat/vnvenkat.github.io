abstract: Approaches for safe execution of JavaScript on web pages have been a topic
  of recent research interest. A significant number of these approaches aim to provide
  safety through runtime mediation of accesses made by a JavaScript program. In this
  paper, we propose a novel, lightweight JavaScript transformation technique for enforcing
  security properties on untrusted JavaScript programs using source code interposition.
  Our approach assures namespace isolation between several principals within a single
  web page, and access control for sensitive browser interfaces. This access control
  mechanism is based on a whitelist approach to ensure soundness of the mediation.
  Our technique is lightweight, resulting in low run-time overhead compared to existing
  solutions such as BrowserShield and Caja.
