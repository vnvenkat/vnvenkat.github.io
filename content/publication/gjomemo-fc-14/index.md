abstract: 'In this paper, we present a digital check forgery attack on check processing
  systems used in online banking that results in check fraud. Such an attack is facilitated
  by multiple factors: the use of digital images to perform check transactions, advances
  in image processing technologies, the use of untrusted client-side devices and software,
  and the modalities of deposit. We note that digital check forgery attacks offer
  better chances of success in committing fraud when compared with conventional check
  forgery attacks. We discuss an instance of this attack and find several leading
  banks vulnerable to digital check forgery.'
