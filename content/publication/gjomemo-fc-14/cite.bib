 abstract = {In this paper, we present a digital check forgery attack on
check processing systems used in online banking that results in check
fraud. Such an attack is facilitated by multiple factors: the use of digital images to perform check transactions, advances in image processing
technologies, the use of untrusted client-side devices and software, and
the modalities of deposit. We note that digital check forgery attacks offer better chances of success in committing fraud when compared with
conventional check forgery attacks. We discuss an instance of this attack
and find several leading banks vulnerable to digital check forgery.},
