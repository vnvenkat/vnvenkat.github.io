abstract: Information security within healthcare is paramount and telemedicine applications
  present unique security challenges. Technology is giving rise to new and advanced
  telemedicine applications and understanding the security threats to these applications
  is needed to ensure, among other things, the privacy of patient information. This
  paper presents a high level analysis of a telemedicine application in order to better
  understand the security threats to this unique and vulnerable environment. This
  risk analysis is performed using the concept of threat tables. This case study focuses
  on the capture and representation of salient security threats in telemedicine. To
  analyze the security threats to an application, we present a threat modeling framework
  utilizing a table driven approach. Our analysis reveals that even in a highly controlled
  environment with static locations, the security risks posed by telemedicine applications
  are significant, and that using a threat table approach provides an easy-to-use
  and effective method for managing these threats.
