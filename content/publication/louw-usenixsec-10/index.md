abstract: Web publishers frequently integrate third-party advertisements into web
  pages that also contain sensitive publisher data and end-user personal data. This
  practice exposes sensitive page content to confidentiality and integrity attacks
  launched by advertisements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for addressing
  security threats posed by third-party advertisements. The heart of our framework
  is an innovative isolation mechanism that enables publishers to transparently interpose
  between advertisements and end users. The mechanism supports finegrained policy
  specification and enforcement, and does not affect the user experience of interactive
  ads. Evaluation of our framework suggests compatibility with several mainstream
  ad networks, security from many threats from advertisements and acceptable performance
  overheads.
