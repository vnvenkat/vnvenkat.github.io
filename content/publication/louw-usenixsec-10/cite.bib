 abstract = {Web publishers frequently integrate third-party advertisements into web pages that also contain sensitive publisher data and end-user personal data. This practice exposes sensitive page content to confidentiality and integrity attacks launched by advertisements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for addressing security
threats posed by third-party advertisements. The heart of
our framework is an innovative isolation mechanism that
enables publishers to transparently interpose between advertisements and end users. The mechanism supports finegrained policy specification and enforcement, and does
not affect the user experience of interactive ads. Evaluation of our framework suggests compatibility with several
mainstream ad networks, security from many threats from
advertisements and acceptable performance overheads.},
