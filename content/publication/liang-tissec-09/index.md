abstract: "In this article, we present an approach for realizing a safe execution
  environment (SEE) that enables users to ``try out'' new software (or configuration
  changes to existing software) without the fear of damaging the system in any manner.
  A key property of our SEE is that it faithfully reproduces the behavior of applications,
  as if they were running natively on the underlying (host) operating system. This
  is accomplished via one-way isolation: processes running within the SEE are given
  read-access to the environment provided by the host OS, but their write operations
  are prevented from escaping outside the SEE. As a result, SEE processes cannot impact
  the behavior of host OS processes, or the integrity of data on the host OS. SEEs
  support a wide range of tasks, including: study of malicious code, controlled execution
  of untrusted software, experimentation with software configuration changes, testing
  of software patches, and so on. It provides a convenient way for users to inspect
  system changes made within the SEE. If these changes are not accepted, they can
  be rolled back at the click of a button. Otherwise, the changes can be committed
  so as to become visible outside the SEE. We provide consistency criteria that ensure
  semantic consistency of the committed results. We develop two different implementation
  approaches, one in user-land and the other in the OS kernel, for realizing a safe-execution
  environment. Our implementation results show that most software, including fairly
  complex server and client applications, can run successfully within our SEEs. It
  introduces low performance overheads, typically below 10 percent."
