abstract: The emergence of exploit kits is one of the most important developments
  in modern cybercrime. Much of cybersecurity research in the recent years has been
  devoted  towards defending citizens from harm delivered through exploit kits. In
  this paper, we examine an alternate, counter-offensive strategy towards combating
  cybercrime launched through exploit kits. Towards this goal, we survey a wide range
  of 30 real-world exploit kits and analyze a counter-offensive adversarial model
  against the kits and kit operator. Guided by our analysis, we present a systematic
  methodology for examining a given kit to determine where vulnerabilities may reside
  within its server side implementation. In our experiments, we found over 180 vulnerabilities
  among 16 exploit kits of those surveyed, and were able to automatically synthesize
  exploits for infiltrating 6 of them. The results validate our hypothesis that exploit
  kits largely lack sophistication necessary to resist counter-offensive activities.
  We then propose the design of EKHUNTER, a system that is capable of automatically
  detecting the presence of exploit vulnerabilities and deriving laboratory test cases
  that can compromise both the integrity of a fielded exploit kit, and even the identity
  of the kit operator
