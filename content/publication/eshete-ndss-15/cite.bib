 abstract = {The emergence of exploit kits is one of the most
important developments in modern cybercrime. Much of cybersecurity research in the recent years has been devoted 
towards defending citizens from harm delivered through exploit kits. In
this paper, we examine an alternate, counter-offensive strategy
towards combating cybercrime launched through exploit kits.
Towards this goal, we survey a wide range of 30 real-world
exploit kits and analyze a counter-offensive adversarial model
against the kits and kit operator. Guided by our analysis, we
present a systematic methodology for examining a given kit to
determine where vulnerabilities may reside within its server side implementation. In our experiments, we found over 180
vulnerabilities among 16 exploit kits of those surveyed, and were
able to automatically synthesize exploits for infiltrating 6 of them.
The results validate our hypothesis that exploit kits largely lack
sophistication necessary to resist counter-offensive activities. We
then propose the design of EKHUNTER, a system that is capable
of automatically detecting the presence of exploit vulnerabilities
and deriving laboratory test cases that can compromise both the
integrity of a fielded exploit kit, and even the identity of the kit
operator},
