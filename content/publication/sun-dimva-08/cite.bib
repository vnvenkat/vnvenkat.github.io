 abstract = {Software installation provides an attractive entry vector for malware: since
installations are performed with administrator privileges, malware can easily get the enhanced level of access needed to install backdoors, spyware, rootkits, or ``bot'' software,
and to hide these installations from users. Previous research has been focused mainly on
securing the execution phase of untrusted software, while largely ignoring the safety of
installations. Even security-enhanced operating systems such as SELinux and Vista don't
usually impose restrictions during software installs, expecting the system administrator to
``know what she is doing.'' This paper addresses this ``gap in armor'' by securing software
installations. Our technique can support a diversity of package managers and software
installers. It is based on a framework that simplifies the development and enforcement of
policies that govern safety of installations. We present a simple policy that can be used
to prevent untrusted software from modifying any of the files used by benign software
packages, thus blocking the most common mechanism used by malware to ensure that it
is run automatically after each system reboot. While the scope of our technique is limited
to the installation phase, it can be easily combined with approaches for secure execution,
e.g., by ensuring that all future runs of an untrusted package will take place within an
administrator-specified sandbox. Our experimental evaluation has considered over one
hundred benign and untrusted software packages. Our technique was able to block malicious packages among these without breaking non-malicious ones.},
