abstract: A system associated with detecting a cyber-attack and reconstructing events
  associated with a cyber-attack campaign, is disclosed. The system performs various
  operations that include receiving an audit data stream associated with cyber events.
  The system identifies trustworthiness values in a portion of data associated with
  the cyber events and assigns provenance tags to the portion of the data based on
  the identified trustworthiness values. An initial visual representation is generated
  based on the assigned provenance tags to the portion of the data. The initial visual
  representation is condensed based on a backward traversal of the initial visual
  representation in identifying a shortest path from a suspect node to an entry point
  node. A scenario visual representation is generated that specifies nodes most relevant
  to the cyber events associated with the cyber-attack based on the identified shortest
  path.A corresponding method and computer-readable medium are also disclosed.
