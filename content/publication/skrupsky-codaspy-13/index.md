abstract: Parameter tampering attacks are dangerous to a web application whose server
  performs weaker data sanitization than its client. This paper presents TamperProof,
  a methodology and tool that offers a novel and efficient mechanism to protect Web
  applications from parameter tampering attacks. TamperProof is an online defense
  deployed in a trusted environment between the client and server and requires no
  access to, or knowledge of, the server side codebase, making it effective for both
  new and legacy applications. The paper reports on experiments that demonstrate TamperProof's
  power in efficiently preventing all known parameter tampering vulnerabilities on
  ten different applications.
