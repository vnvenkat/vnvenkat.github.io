abstract: Traditionally, the provided service of Internet transport protocols is reliable/ordered
  or unreliable/unordered service, respectively. It has been widely accepted that
  a variety of applications (e.g. multimedia) can tradeoff reliability mechanisms
  to achieve higher throughput. Such a solution, which additionally respects user
  preferences for QoS characteristics (e.g. reliability, cost, throughput, delay)
  is a current demand. We propose an application-oriented transport protocol (AOTP)
  to handle partially or completely reliable transport service favoring throughput
  at the expense of reliability, or dropping the reliability level in order to keep
  the cost at a desired level. The protocol can be applied to cases where resource
  reservation is not possible or desired. Our approach does not use forward error
  correction to save bandwidth, but uses instead, a receiver-based retransmission
  mechanism. Therefore, the protocol is appropriate for applications that tolerate
  losses and thus, the need for retransmission (additional RTTs) does not arise often.
  We present encouraging initial results tested over Ethernet links; we compare AOTP
  with TCP and a TCP-like protocol without congestion control (TCPWCC), contrasting
  throughput results for different levels of reliability requirements.
