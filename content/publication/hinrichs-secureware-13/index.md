abstract: "Modern web applications validate user-supplied data in two places: the
  server (to protect against attacks such as parameter tampering) and the client (to
  give the user a rich, interactive data-entry experience). However, today's web development
  frameworks provide little support for ensuring that client- and server-side validation
  is kept in sync. In this paper, we introduce CAVEAT, a tool that automatically creates
  clientside input validation for Ruby on Rails applications by analyzing server-side
  validation routines. The effectiveness of CAVEAT for new applications is demonstrated
  by developing three custom apps, and its applicability to existing applications
  is demonstrated by examining 25 open-source applications."
