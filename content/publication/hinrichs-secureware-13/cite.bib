 abstract = {Modern web applications validate user-supplied
data in two places: the server (to protect against attacks such
as parameter tampering) and the client (to give the user a
rich, interactive data-entry experience). However, today's web
development frameworks provide little support for ensuring that
client- and server-side validation is kept in sync. In this paper,
we introduce CAVEAT, a tool that automatically creates clientside input validation for Ruby on Rails applications by analyzing
server-side validation routines. The effectiveness of CAVEAT for
new applications is demonstrated by developing three custom
apps, and its applicability to existing applications is demonstrated
by examining 25 open-source applications.},
