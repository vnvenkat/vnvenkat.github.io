 abstract = {As online product reviews become ubiquitous, more
individuals increasingly write and rely on them. In an effort to
share their experiences and opinions about a product, do
individuals share private and sensitive information online?
This study addresses this critical issue by examining the extent
of sensitive information disclosed in Amazon.com's product
reviews. We crawled Amazon.com and gathered all online
reviews posted for six products that pertained to weight loss,
anti-aging, sex-related, fragrance, baby care and electronic
goods. This resulted in 3,485 reviews, which were textanalyzed and mined using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC) analysis. Then, data processed through LIWC were
further analyzed through descriptive statistics and
discriminant analysis. We found that Amazon's reviewers
disclose high levels of sensitive information in the following
categories: family, humans, positive emotions, negative
emotions, sadness, cognitive mechanisms, concerns related to
work, achievements, leisure and money. Sensitive disclosure is
also found to be a function of the type of reviewer and of the
anonymization strategies adopted.},
