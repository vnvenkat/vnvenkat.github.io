abstract: "As online product reviews become ubiquitous, more individuals increasingly
  write and rely on them. In an effort to share their experiences and opinions about
  a product, do individuals share private and sensitive information online? This study
  addresses this critical issue by examining the extent of sensitive information disclosed
  in Amazon.com's product reviews. We crawled Amazon.com and gathered all online reviews
  posted for six products that pertained to weight loss, anti-aging, sex-related,
  fragrance, baby care and electronic goods. This resulted in 3,485 reviews, which
  were textanalyzed and mined using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis.
  Then, data processed through LIWC were further analyzed through descriptive statistics
  and discriminant analysis. We found that Amazon's reviewers disclose high levels
  of sensitive information in the following categories: family, humans, positive emotions,
  negative emotions, sadness, cognitive mechanisms, concerns related to work, achievements,
  leisure and money. Sensitive disclosure is also found to be a function of the type
  of reviewer and of the anonymization strategies adopted."
