 abstract = {Traditionally, operating systems have employed
Discretionary Access Controls (DACs) as their authorization model.
We have implemented a new authorization model called
kernelsec, which provides a much richer set of controls than DACs and thus
provides more refined protections.
In this paper, we describe a programming language-based analysis to
``lift'' the existing application base from the Linux DAC
to the kernelsec authorization model.


The authorization model, which is part of the Operating System (OS) Kernel,
controls a process's external interaction by allowing or denying
operations requested by the process.
In a traditional DAC authorization model,
the user who created an object, such as a file,
is the owner of that object and determines who can access the object.
Unfortunately, DAC models are incapable of
providing strong security properties,
leading to a culture of ``blame the user'' when something goes wrong.

An alternative is to provide
Mandatory Access Controls (MACs)
which can enforce organizational rules
We note that Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)  and
SPBAC  can provide either DAC or MAC.
MACs can be integrated with DACs by allowing the user to decide
permissions that are not mandated by the organization.
This paper explores some of the issues in transitioning from a DAC-based
to a MAC-based authorization model and
the role compilers and programming languages can play.},
