abstract: In this paper, we present HOLMES, a system that implements a new approach
  to the detection of Advanced and Persistent Threats (APTs). HOLMES is inspired by
  several case studies of real-world APTs that highlight some common goals of APT
  actors. In a nutshell, HOLMES aims to produce a detection signal that indicates
  the presence of a coordinated set of activities that are part of an APT campaign.
  One of the main challenges addressed by our approach involves developing a suite
  of techniques that make the detection signal robust and reliable. At a high-level,
  the techniques we develop effectively leverage the correlation between suspicious
  information flows that arise during an attacker campaign. In addition to its detection
  capability, HOLMES is also able to generate a high-level graph that summarizes the
  attacker's actions in real-time. This graph can be used by an analyst for an effective
  cyber response. An evaluation of our approach against some real-world APTs indicates
  that HOLMES can detect APT campaigns with high precision and low false alarm rate.
  The compact high-level graphs produced by HOLMES effectively summarizes an ongoing
  attack campaign and can assist real-time cyber-response operations.
