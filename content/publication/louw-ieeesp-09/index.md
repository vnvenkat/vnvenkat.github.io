abstract: As social networking sites proliferate across the World Wide Web, complex
  user-created HTML content is rapidly becoming the norm rather than the exception.
  User-created web content is a notorious vector for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
  that target websites and confidential user data. In this threat climate, mechanisms
  that render web applications immune to XSS attacks have been of recent research
  interest. A challenge for these security mechanisms is enabling web applications
  to accept complex HTML input from users, while disallowing malicious script content.
  This challenge is made difficult by anomalous web browser behaviors, which are often
  used as vectors for successful XSS attacks.  Motivated by this problem, we present
  a new XSS defense strategy designed to be effective in widely deployed existing
  web browsers, despite anomalous browser behavior. Our approach seeks to minimize
  trust placed on browsers for interpreting untrusted content. We implemented this
  approach in a tool called BLUEPRINT that was integrated with several popular web
  applications. We evaluated BLUEPRINT against a barrage of stress tests that demonstrate
  strong resistance to attacks, excellent compatibility with web browsers and reasonable
  performance overheads.
