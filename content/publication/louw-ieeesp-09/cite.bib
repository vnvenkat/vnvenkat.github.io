 abstract = {As social networking sites proliferate across the
World Wide Web, complex user-created HTML content
is rapidly becoming the norm rather than the exception.
User-created web content is a notorious vector for
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that target websites
and confidential user data. In this threat climate,
mechanisms that render web applications immune to
XSS attacks have been of recent research interest.
A challenge for these security mechanisms is enabling web applications to accept complex HTML input
from users, while disallowing malicious script content.
This challenge is made difficult by anomalous web
browser behaviors, which are often used as vectors for
successful XSS attacks.

Motivated by this problem, we present a new XSS
defense strategy designed to be effective in widely
deployed existing web browsers, despite anomalous
browser behavior. Our approach seeks to minimize
trust placed on browsers for interpreting untrusted
content. We implemented this approach in a tool called
BLUEPRINT that was integrated with several popular
web applications. We evaluated BLUEPRINT against
a barrage of stress tests that demonstrate strong resistance to attacks, excellent compatibility with web
browsers and reasonable performance overheads.},
