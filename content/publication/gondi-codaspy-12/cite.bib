 abstract = {We describe SWIPE, an approach to reduce the life time of sensitive, memory resident data in large scale applications written in C. In contrast to prior approaches that used a delayed or lazy approach to the problem of erasing sensitive data, SWIPE uses a novel eager erasure approach that minimizes the risk of accidental sensitive data leakage. SWIPE achieves this by transforming a legacy C program to include additional instructions that erase sensitive data immediately after its intended use. SWIPE is guided by a highly-scalable static analysis technique that precisely identifies the locations to introduce erase instructions in the original program. The programs transformed using SWIPE enjoy several additional benefits: minimization of leaks that arise due to data dependencies; erasure of sensitive data with minimal developer guidance; and negligible performance overheads.},
