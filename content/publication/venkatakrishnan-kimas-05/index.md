abstract: In this paper, we provide a framework that supports composition of individual
  agents that enables users to accomplish complex tasks that would otherwise be laborious
  and difficult with mere use of traditional keyword based search engines. A key benefit
  of our approach is that in the framework the personal information handled by the
  agent system is guaranteed to be free from accidental leakage to Websites that are
  not trustworthy, thereby ensuring the privacy of end-user data. We describe our
  approach with a prototype example which suggests that such highly usable, trustworthy
  agent systems can be built and deployed quickly with modest implementation efforts.
