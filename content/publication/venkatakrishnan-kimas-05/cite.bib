 abstract = {In this paper, we provide a framework that supports composition of individual agents that enables users to accomplish complex tasks that would otherwise be laborious and difficult with mere use of traditional keyword based search engines. A key benefit of our approach is that in the framework the personal information handled by the agent system is guaranteed to be free from accidental leakage to Websites that are not trustworthy, thereby ensuring the privacy of end-user data. We describe our approach with a prototype example which suggests that such highly usable, trustworthy agent systems can be built and deployed quickly with modest implementation efforts.},
