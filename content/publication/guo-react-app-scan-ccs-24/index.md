abstract: 'React, a single-page application framework, has recently become popular
  among web developers due to its flexible and convenient management of web application
  states via a syntax extension to JavaScript, called JSX (JavaScript and XML). Despite
  its abundant functionalities, the security of React, especially vulnerability detection,
  still lags: many existing vulnerability detection works do not support JSX let alone
  React Data Flow introduced by React components. The only exception is CodeQL, which
  supports JSX syntax. However, CodeQL cannot properly track React Data Flow across
  different components for detecting vulnerabilities.In this paper, we design a novel
  framework, called ReactAppScan, which constructs a Component Graph (CoG) for tracking
  React Data Flow and detecting vulnerabilities following both JavaScript and React
  data flows. Specifically, ReactAppScan relies on abstract interpretation to build
  such a component graph via tracking component lifecycles and then detects vulnerabilities
  via finding paths between sources and sinks. Our evaluation shows that ReactAppScan
  detects 61 zero-day vulnerabilities in real-world React applications. We have responsibly
  reported all the vulnerabilities and so far six vulnerabilities have been fixed
  and two have been acknowledged.'
