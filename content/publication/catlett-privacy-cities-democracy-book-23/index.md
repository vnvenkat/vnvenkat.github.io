abstract: "The notion of a â€œsmartâ€\x9D city has too often been reduced to the use
  of technology to automate processes toward more efficiency and cost savings in areas
  such as transportation, public safety, or energy. These are important objectives
  to be sure, but the most vexing challenges faced by cities and their inhabitants
  are less obviously amenable to purely technical solutions, as these relate to human
  and societal needs such as for opportunity, fairness, safety, and justice. While
  cities attempt to manage their operations through smart city solutions, no amount
  of automation or efficiency will automatically make a city â€œsmartâ€\x9D if these
  human and societal needs are not integrated with, or ideally driving, those solutions.
  Moreover, a focus on technological systems introduces at least two hidden dangers.
  First, managing complex technological systems requires controlling and monitoring
  those systems, leading to concepts such as an â€œoperating systemâ€\x9D for the
  city and a trend from automation to autonomous systems. This is partly fueled by
  increasing capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML),
  in turn enabling ever more sophisticated autonomous systems. But operating systems
  are, predominantly, authoritarian systems and AI capabilities, while extraordinarily
  useful for many mechanical and mathematical functions, have yet to overcome critical
  challenges such as bias and judgment, much less understanding human concepts of
  opportunity or fairness. Second, new technologies introduce new capabilities not
  yet contemplated by society or governance structures and the potential for derivative
  capabilities that may not have been anticipated even by the system designers themselves.
  Thus, these new capabilities operate not only absent appropriate policy but in advance
  of a clear concept of what those appropriate policies should be! We discuss these
  challenges in the context of real-world smart city deployments, the impact of such
  technologies on assumptions about"
