abstract: Modern websites and web applications commonly integrate third-party and
  user-generated content to enrich the user's experience. Developers of these applications
  are in need of a simple way to limit the capabilities of this less trusted, outsourced
  web content and thereby protect their users from cross-site scripting attacks. We
  summarize several recent proposals that enable developers to isolate untrusted hypertext,
  and could be used to define robust constraint environments that are enforceable
  by web browsers. A comparative analysis of these proposals is presented highlighting
  security, legacy browser compatibility and several other important qualities.
