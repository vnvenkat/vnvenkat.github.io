 abstract = {Modern websites and web applications commonly integrate third-party and user-generated content to enrich the
user's experience. Developers of these applications are
in need of a simple way to limit the capabilities of this
less trusted, outsourced web content and thereby protect
their users from cross-site scripting attacks. We summarize several recent proposals that enable developers to isolate untrusted hypertext, and could be used to define robust constraint environments that are enforceable by web
browsers. A comparative analysis of these proposals is
presented highlighting security, legacy browser compatibility and several other important qualities.},
