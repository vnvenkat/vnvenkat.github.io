abstract: The distributed and decentralized nature of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks
  has offered a lucrative alternative to bot-masters to build botnets. P2P botnets
  are not prone to any single point of failure and have been proven to be highly resilient
  against takedown attempts. Moreover, smarter bots are stealthy in their communication
  patterns and elude the standard discovery techniques which look for anomalous network
  or communication behavior. In this paper, we present a methodology to detect P2P
  botnet traffic and differentiate it from benign P2P traffic in a network. Our approach
  neither assumes the availability of any `seed' information of bots nor relies on
  deep packet inspection. It aims to detect the stealthy behavior of P2P botnets.
  That is, we aim to detect P2P botnets when they lie dormant (to evade detection
  by intrusion detection systems) or while they perform malicious activities (spamming,
  password stealing, etc.) in a manner which is not observable to a network administrator.  Our
  approach PeerSharkPeerShark combines the benefits of flow-based and conversation-based
  approaches with a two-tier architecture, and addresses the limitations of these
  approaches. By extracting statistical features from the network traces of P2P applications
  and botnets, we build supervised machine learning models which can accurately differentiate
  between benign P2P applications and P2P botnets. PeerSharkPeerShark could also detect
  unknown P2P botnet traffic with high accuracy.
