abstract: Parameter tampering attacks are dangerous to a web application whose server
  fails to replicate the validation of user-supplied data that is performed by the
  client. Malicious users who circumvent the client can capitalize on the missing
  server validation. In this paper, we describe WAPTEC, a tool that is designed to
  automatically identify parameter tampering vulnerabilities and generate exploits
  by construction to demonstrate those vulnerabilities. WAPTEC involves a new approach
  to whitebox analysis of the server's code. We tested WAPTEC on six open source applications
  and found previously unknown vulnerabilities in every single one of them.
