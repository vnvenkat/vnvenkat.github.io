 abstract = {Parameter tampering attacks are dangerous to a web application
whose server fails to replicate the validation of user-supplied data
that is performed by the client. Malicious users who circumvent
the client can capitalize on the missing server validation. In this paper, we describe WAPTEC, a tool that is designed to automatically
identify parameter tampering vulnerabilities and generate exploits
by construction to demonstrate those vulnerabilities. WAPTEC
involves a new approach to whitebox analysis of the server's code.
We tested WAPTEC on six open source applications and found
previously unknown vulnerabilities in every single one of them.},
