abstract: 'Compilers perform a static analysis of a program prior to optimization.
  The precision of this analysis is limited, however, by strict time budgets for compilation.
  We explore an alternative, new approach, which links external sound static analysis
  tools into compilers. One of the key problems to be solved is that of propagating
  the source-level information gathered by a static analyzer deeper into the optimization
  pipeline. We propose a method to achieve this, and demonstrate its feasibility through
  an implementation using the LLVM compiler infrastructure. We show how assertions
  obtained from the Frama-C source code analysis platform are propagated through LLVM
  and are then used to substantially improve the effectiveness of several optimizations. '
