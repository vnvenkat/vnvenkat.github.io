 abstract = {Web applications rely heavily on client-side computation to examine and validate form inputs that are supplied by a user (e.g., ``credit
card expiration date must be valid''). This is typically done for
two reasons: to reduce burden on the server and to avoid latencies
in communicating with the server. However, when a server fails
to replicate the validation performed on the client, it is potentially
vulnerable to attack. In this paper, we present a novel approach for
automatically detecting potential server-side vulnerabilities of this
kind in existing (legacy) web applications through blackbox analysis. We discuss the design and implementation of NOTAMPER, a
tool that realizes this approach. NOTAMPER has been employed to
discover several previously unknown vulnerabilities in a number of
open-source web applications and live web sites.},
