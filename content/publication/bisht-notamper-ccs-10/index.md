abstract: "Web applications rely heavily on client-side computation to examine and
  validate form inputs that are supplied by a user (e.g., ``credit card expiration
  date must be valid''). This is typically done for two reasons: to reduce burden
  on the server and to avoid latencies in communicating with the server. However,
  when a server fails to replicate the validation performed on the client, it is potentially
  vulnerable to attack. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically
  detecting potential server-side vulnerabilities of this kind in existing (legacy)
  web applications through blackbox analysis. We discuss the design and implementation
  of NOTAMPER, a tool that realizes this approach. NOTAMPER has been employed to discover
  several previously unknown vulnerabilities in a number of open-source web applications
  and live web sites."
