abstract: Security Operation Centers (SOCs) are the first line of defense against
  an increasingly complex and sophisticated environment of advanced persistent threats
  (APTs). Inside SOCs, analysts deal with thousands of alerts every day and have to
  make real-time decisions about whether alerts are worth investigating further. However,
  they face several challenges in efficiently investigating a significant number of
  alerts daily and reconstructing attack scenarios from those alerts. In this paper,
  we present Citar, an approach for leveraging cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to
  facilitate attack scenario reconstruction. Citar enhances alert investigation by
  attributing alerts to potential attacker groups and examining audit logs for related
  attack instances. Utilizing a new correlation analysis developed for this purpose,
  we identify potential connections between flagged alerts and known attack behaviors
  present in a system. Citar is evaluated using a DARPA public dataset and 10 new
  attack scenarios (five real-world APT groups and five popular malwares). Our evaluation
  shows that augmenting existing detection mechanisms with Citar improves detection
  performance by up to 57%, significantly aiding SOC analysts in alert investigations
  and attack reconstructions.
