 abstract = {Parameter tampering attacks are dangerous to a web application whose server fails to replicate the validation of user-supplied data that is performed by the client in web forms. Malicious users who circumvent the client can capitalize on the missing server validation. In this paper, we provide a formal description of parameter tampering vulnerabilities and a high level approach for their detection. We specialize this high level approach to develop complementary detection solutions in two interesting settings: blackbox only analyze client-side code in web forms and whitebox also analyze server-side code that processes submitted web forms. This paper presents interesting challenges encountered in realizing the high level approach for each setting and novel technical contributions that address these challenges. We also contrast utility, difficulties and effectiveness issues in both settings and provide a quantitative comparison of results. Our experiments with real world and open source applications demonstrate that parameter tampering vulnerabilities are prolific total 47 in 9 applications, and their exploitation can have serious consequences including unauthorized transactions, account hijacking and financial losses. We conclude this paper with a discussion on countermeasures for parameter tampering attacks and present a detailed survey of existing defenses and their suitability.},
