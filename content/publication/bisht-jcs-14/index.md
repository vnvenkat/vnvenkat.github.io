abstract: 'Parameter tampering attacks are dangerous to a web application whose server
  fails to replicate the validation of user-supplied data that is performed by the
  client in web forms. Malicious users who circumvent the client can capitalize on
  the missing server validation. In this paper, we provide a formal description of
  parameter tampering vulnerabilities and a high level approach for their detection.
  We specialize this high level approach to develop complementary detection solutions
  in two interesting settings: blackbox only analyze client-side code in web forms
  and whitebox also analyze server-side code that processes submitted web forms. This
  paper presents interesting challenges encountered in realizing the high level approach
  for each setting and novel technical contributions that address these challenges.
  We also contrast utility, difficulties and effectiveness issues in both settings
  and provide a quantitative comparison of results. Our experiments with real world
  and open source applications demonstrate that parameter tampering vulnerabilities
  are prolific total 47 in 9 applications, and their exploitation can have serious
  consequences including unauthorized transactions, account hijacking and financial
  losses. We conclude this paper with a discussion on countermeasures for parameter
  tampering attacks and present a detailed survey of existing defenses and their suitability.'
