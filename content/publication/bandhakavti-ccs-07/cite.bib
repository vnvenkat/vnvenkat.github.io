 abstract = {SQL injection attacks are one of the topmost threats for applications written for the Web. These attacks are launched
through specially crafted user input on web applications that
use low level string operations to construct SQL queries. In
this work, we exhibit a novel and powerful scheme for automatically transforming web applications to render them safe
against all SQL injection attacks.
A characteristic diagnostic feature of SQL injection attacks is that they change the intended structure of queries
issued. Our technique for detecting SQL injection is to dynamically mine the programmer-intended query structure
on any input, and to detect attacks by comparing them
against the intended query structure. We propose a simple and novel mechanism, called Candid, for mining programmer intended queries by dynamically evaluating runs
over benign candidate inputs. This mechanism is theoretically well founded and is based on inferring intended queries
by considering the symbolic query computed on a program
run. Our approach has been implemented in a tool called
Candid that retrofits Web applications written in Java to
defend them against SQL injection attacks. We report extensive experimental results that show that our approach
performs remarkably well in practice.},
