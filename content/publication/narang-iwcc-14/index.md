abstract: The decentralized nature of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets makes them difficult
  to detect. Their distributed nature also exhibits resilience against take-down attempts.
  Moreover, smarter bots are stealthy in their communication patterns, and elude the
  standard discovery techniques which look for anomalous network or communication
  behavior. In this paper, we propose PeerShark, a novel methodology to detect P2P
  botnet traffic and differentiate it from benign P2P traffic in a network. Instead
  of the traditional 5-tuple `flow-based' detection approach, we use a 2-tuple `conversation-based'
  approach which is port-oblivious, protocol-oblivious and does not require Deep Packet
  Inspection. PeerShark could also classify different P2P applications with an accuracy
  of more than 95%.
