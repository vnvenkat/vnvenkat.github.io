 abstract = {The decentralized nature of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets makes them difficult to detect. Their distributed nature also
exhibits resilience against take-down attempts. Moreover, smarter
bots are stealthy in their communication patterns, and elude
the standard discovery techniques which look for anomalous
network or communication behavior. In this paper, we propose
PeerShark, a novel methodology to detect P2P botnet traffic and
differentiate it from benign P2P traffic in a network. Instead of
the traditional 5-tuple `flow-based' detection approach, we use
a 2-tuple `conversation-based' approach which is port-oblivious,
protocol-oblivious and does not require Deep Packet Inspection.
PeerShark could also classify different P2P applications with an
accuracy of more than 95%.},
