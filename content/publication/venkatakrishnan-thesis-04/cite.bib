 abstract = {Execution monitoring is a powerful practical technique for enforcement of security policies. In this dissertation, we discuss some of the limitations of existing execution monitoring mechanisms, and develop new techniques that suitably adapt execution monitoring approaches for enforcement of security policies that address confidentiality and integrity of information. In situations where enforcement of policies that address confidentiality and integrity requirements could be directly specified in terms of resource access operations, our execution monitoring approach supports a richer class of access control policies (that support notions such as access history and resource accounting). However, there may exist situations where such requirements cannot simply be addressed by access control. We present two such scenarios and discuss enforcement techniques for these scenarios. The first scenario is one that involves execution of a faulty program (e.g., a freeware file compression utility) or an untrusted program, operating on system or application data. In this case, access control or conventional execution monitoring techniques do not work, as they typically disallow execution any such operations (e.g., modifications to such files) in the first place. We present a solution that is based on program isolation, that works by isolating the effects of the faulty/untrusted program execution from the rest of the system. The second scenario relates data and control flow errors in a program that operates on sensitive data, resulting in loss of data confidentiality. Here too, it is well known that the problem cannot be solved by the use of execution monitors that employ purely runtime monitoring mechanisms. The key idea is to augment execution monitoring mechanisms with information obtained by static analysis of the program. By using a preliminary static analysis to analyze possible information flows in a program, and by combining this analysis with runtime checking techniques, a more precise solution is possible. In all the scenarios mentioned above, we illustrate the approaches that are employed using several practical examples. Finally, we describe a model-based certification mechanism for enforcement of privacy properties.},
