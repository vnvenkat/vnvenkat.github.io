abstract: All major banks in the USA and around the world offer remote check deposit
  services. Consumers can use their smart phones to deposit checks remotely. This
  new online check truncation system is vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, including
  digital check forgery. Shifting trust from a human teller or an automated teller
  machine (ATM) to a smart device (cell phone) provides new attack surfaces. This
  paper exploits security vulnerabilities in the existing remote check deposit system
  and presents an attack vector for existing remote check truncation systems. The
  proposed attack vector exploits vulnerabilities in the untrusted client-side check-deposit
  system that enables an attacker to instrument the check deposit application library.
  The instrumented library allows the attacker to induce digital check forgery with
  minimized tampering artifacts. It has been observed through this investigation that
  digital check forgery-based attacks are more powerful than conventional paper-based
  check forgery attacks. The effectiveness of these attacks is evaluated by targeting
  three leading banks in United States, finding that all three of the targeted banks
  are vulnerable to the proposed attacks. A set of countermeasures based on digital
  check verification is also proposed to combat digital check forgery attacks on existing
  remote check deposit systems. The proposed countermeasures rely on tamper detection
  in digital images and expert-system based decision fusion. The effectiveness of
  the proposed framework is evaluated using tampered check images. The tampered images
  used for performance evaluation also include set of tampered images used for successfully
  attacking the remote check deposit systems(being using by leading banks around the
  world today). Experimental results show that the proposed expert system-based framework
  is capable of detecting digital check forgery attacks.
