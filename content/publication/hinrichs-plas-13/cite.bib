 abstract = {WEBLOG is a declarative language for web application development designed to automatically eliminate several security vulnerabilities common to today's web applications. In this paper, we introduce Weblog, detail the security vulnerabilities it eliminates, and discuss how those vulnerabilities are eliminated. We then evaluate Weblog's ability to build and secure real-world applications by comparing traditional implementations of 3 existing small- to medium-size web applications to Weblog implementations.},
