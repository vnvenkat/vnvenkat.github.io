abstract: WEBLOG is a declarative language for web application development designed
  to automatically eliminate several security vulnerabilities common to today's web
  applications. In this paper, we introduce Weblog, detail the security vulnerabilities
  it eliminates, and discuss how those vulnerabilities are eliminated. We then evaluate
  Weblog's ability to build and secure real-world applications by comparing traditional
  implementations of 3 existing small- to medium-size web applications to Weblog implementations.
