abstract: A concern about personal information confidentiality typically arises when
  any desktop application communicates to the external network, for example, to its
  producer's server for obtaining software version updates. We address this confidentiality
  concern of end users by an approach called shadow execution. A key property of shadow
  execution is that it allows applications to successfully communicate over the network
  while disallowing any information leaks. We describe the design and implementation
  of this approach for Windows applications. Experiments with our prototype implementation
  indicate that shadow execution allows applications to execute without inhibiting
  any behaviors, has acceptable performance overheads while preventing any information
  leaks.
