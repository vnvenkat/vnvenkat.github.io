 abstract = {A concern about personal information confidentiality
typically arises when any desktop application communicates to the external network, for example, to its producer's server for obtaining software version updates.
We address this confidentiality concern of end users by
an approach called shadow execution. A key property of
shadow execution is that it allows applications to successfully communicate over the network while disallowing any information leaks. We describe the design and
implementation of this approach for Windows applications. Experiments with our prototype implementation
indicate that shadow execution allows applications to
execute without inhibiting any behaviors, has acceptable performance overheads while preventing any information leaks.},
