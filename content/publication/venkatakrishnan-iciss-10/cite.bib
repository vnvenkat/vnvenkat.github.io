 abstract = {As the World Wide Web continues to evolve, the number of web-based attacks that target web applications is on the rise. Attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection and Cross-site Request Forgery (XSRF) are among the topmost threats on the Web, and defending against these attacks is a growing concern. In this paper, we describe WebAppArmor, a framework that is aimed at preventing these attacks on existing (legacy) web applications. The main feature of this framework is that it offers a unified perspective to address these problems in the context of existing web applications. The framework incorporates techniques based on static and dynamic analysis, symbolic evaluation and execution monitoring to retrofit existing web applications to be resilient to these attacks.},
