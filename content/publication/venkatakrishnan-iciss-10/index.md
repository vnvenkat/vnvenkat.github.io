abstract: As the World Wide Web continues to evolve, the number of web-based attacks
  that target web applications is on the rise. Attacks such as Cross-site Scripting
  (XSS), SQL Injection and Cross-site Request Forgery (XSRF) are among the topmost
  threats on the Web, and defending against these attacks is a growing concern. In
  this paper, we describe WebAppArmor, a framework that is aimed at preventing these
  attacks on existing (legacy) web applications. The main feature of this framework
  is that it offers a unified perspective to address these problems in the context
  of existing web applications. The framework incorporates techniques based on static
  and dynamic analysis, symbolic evaluation and execution monitoring to retrofit existing
  web applications to be resilient to these attacks.
