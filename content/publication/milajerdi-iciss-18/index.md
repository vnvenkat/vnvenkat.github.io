abstract: "Kernel audit logs are an invaluable source of information in the forensic
  investigation of a cyber-attack. However, the coarse granularity of dependency information
  in audit logs leads to the construction of huge attack graphs which contain false
  or inaccurate dependencies. To overcome this problem, we propose a system, called
  ProPatrol, which leverages the open compartmentalized design in families of enterprise
  applications used in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., browser, chat client, email
  client). To achieve its goal, ProPatrol infers a model for an application's high-level
  tasks as input-processing compartments using purely the audit log events generated
  by that application. The main benefit of this approach is that it does not rely
  on source code or binary instrumentation, but only on a preliminary and general
  knowledge of an application's architecture to bootstrap the analysis. Our experiments
  with enterprise-level attacks demonstrate that ProPatrol significantly cuts down
  the forensic investigation effort and quickly pinpoints the root-cause of attacks.
  ProPatrol incurs less than 2% runtime overhead on a commodity operating system. "
