 abstract = {Threat Intelligence (TI) serves as a vital component of cybersecurity, empowering organizations to combat cyber threats proactively. While existing research primarily focuses on analyzing threat intelligence feeds from Threat Intelligence Sharing Platforms (TISPs), the extensive data available within TISPs knowledge bases remains largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel approach to perform the first in-depth empirical study of prominent TISPs' databases. To achieve this, we propose an innovative approach to construct a ground truth dataset of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) derived from threat reports. We implement our approach in a tool called TIPCE, which processes over 50,000 threat reports, extracting more than 182K IOCs with high accuracy. TIPCE leverages this dataset to measure and study different features of four known TISP databases, including their coverage, overlap, and timeliness. Our results provide novel longitudinal insights into TISPs, including their distinct performance per IOC type and considerable overlap between TISP databases.},
