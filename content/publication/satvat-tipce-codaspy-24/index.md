abstract: Threat Intelligence (TI) serves as a vital component of cybersecurity, empowering
  organizations to combat cyber threats proactively. While existing research primarily
  focuses on analyzing threat intelligence feeds from Threat Intelligence Sharing
  Platforms (TISPs), the extensive data available within TISPs knowledge bases remains
  largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel approach
  to perform the first in-depth empirical study of prominent TISPs' databases. To
  achieve this, we propose an innovative approach to construct a ground truth dataset
  of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) derived from threat reports. We implement our
  approach in a tool called TIPCE, which processes over 50,000 threat reports, extracting
  more than 182K IOCs with high accuracy. TIPCE leverages this dataset to measure
  and study different features of four known TISP databases, including their coverage,
  overlap, and timeliness. Our results provide novel longitudinal insights into TISPs,
  including their distinct performance per IOC type and considerable overlap between
  TISP databases.
