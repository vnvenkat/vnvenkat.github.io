abstract: We present an approach that addresses the problem of securing software configurations
  from the security-relevant actions of poorly built/faulty installation packages.
  Our approach is based on a policy-based control of the package manager's actions
  and is customizable for site-specific policies. We discuss an implementation of
  this approach in the context of the Linux operating system for the Red Hat Package
  manager (RPM).
