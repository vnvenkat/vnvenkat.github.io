 abstract = {We present an approach that addresses the problem of securing software configurations from the security-relevant actions of poorly built/faulty installation packages. Our approach is based on a policy-based control of the package manager's actions and is customizable for site-specific policies. We discuss an implementation of this approach in the context of the Linux operating system for the Red Hat Package manager (RPM).},
