abstract: We present an approach and system for real-time reconstruction of attack
  scenarios on an enterprise host. To meet the scalability and real-time needs of
  the problem, we develop a platform-neutral, main-memory based, dependency graph
  abstraction of audit-log data. We then present efficient, tag-based techniques for
  attack detection and reconstruction, including source identification and impact
  analysis. We also develop methods to reveal the big picture of attacks by construction
  of compact, visual graphs of attack steps. Our system participated in a red team
  evaluation organized by DARPA and was able to successfully detect and reconstruct
  the details of the red team's attacks on hosts running Windows, FreeBSD and Linux.
