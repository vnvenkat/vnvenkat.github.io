abstract: The prolonged lifetime of sensitive data (such as passwords) in applications
  gives rise to several security risks. A promising approach is to erase sensitive
  data in an \"eager fashion\", i.e., as soon as its use is no longer required in
  the application. This approach of minimizing the lifetime of sensitive data has
  been applied to sequential programs. In this short paper, we present an extension
  of the this approach to concurrent programs where the interleaving of threads makes
  such eager erasures a challenging research problem.
