 abstract = {We tackle the problem of automated exploit generation for
web applications. In this regard, we present an approach
that significantly improves the state-of-art in web injection
vulnerability identification and exploit generation. Our approach for exploit generation tackles various challenges associated with typical web application characteristics: their
multi-module nature, interposed user input, and multi-tier
architectures using a database backend. Our approach develops precise models of application workflows, database
schemas, and native functions to achieve high quality exploit
generation. We implemented our approach in a tool called
Chainsaw. Chainsaw was used to analyze 9 open source
applications and generated over 199 first- and second-order
injection exploits combined, significantly outperforming several related approaches.},
