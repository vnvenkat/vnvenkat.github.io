abstract: 'We tackle the problem of automated exploit generation for web applications.
  In this regard, we present an approach that significantly improves the state-of-art
  in web injection vulnerability identification and exploit generation. Our approach
  for exploit generation tackles various challenges associated with typical web application
  characteristics: their multi-module nature, interposed user input, and multi-tier
  architectures using a database backend. Our approach develops precise models of
  application workflows, database schemas, and native functions to achieve high quality
  exploit generation. We implemented our approach in a tool called Chainsaw. Chainsaw
  was used to analyze 9 open source applications and generated over 199 first- and
  second-order injection exploits combined, significantly outperforming several related
  approaches.'
