abstract: The knowledge on attacks contained in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports
  is very important to effectively identify and quickly respond to cyber threats.
  However, this knowledge is often embedded in large amounts of text, and therefore
  difficult to use effectively. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach
  and tool called Extractor that allows precise automatic extraction of concise attack
  behaviors from CTI reports. Extractor makes no strong assumptions about the text
  and is capable of extracting attack behaviors as provenance graphs from unstructured
  text. We evaluate Extractor using real-world incident reports from various sources
  as well as reports of DARPA adversarial engagements that involve several attack
  campaigns on various OS platforms of Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. Our evaluation
  results show that Extractor can extract concise provenance graphs from CTI reports
  and show that these graphs can successfully be used by cyber-analytics tools in
  threat-hunting.
