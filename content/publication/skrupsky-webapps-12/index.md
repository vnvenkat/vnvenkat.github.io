abstract: We outline the groundwork for a new software development approach where
  developers author the server-side application logic and rely on tools to automatically
  synthesize the corresponding client-side application logic. Our approach uses program
  analysis techniques to extract a logical specification from the server and synthesizes
  client code from that specification. Our implementation (WAVES) synthesizes interactive
  client interfaces that include asynchronous callbacks whose performance and coverage
  rival that of manually written clients, while ensuring that no new security vulnerabilities
  are introduced.
