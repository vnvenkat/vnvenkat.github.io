 abstract = {We outline the groundwork for a new software development approach where developers author the server-side application logic and rely on tools to automatically synthesize the corresponding client-side application logic. Our approach uses program analysis techniques to extract a logical specification from the server and synthesizes client code from that specification. Our implementation (WAVES) synthesizes interactive client interfaces that include asynchronous callbacks whose performance and coverage rival that of manually written clients, while ensuring that no new security vulnerabilities are introduced.},
