 abstract = {XMC is a toolset for specifying and verifying concurrent systems. Its main mode of verification is temporal-logic model checking, although equivalence checkers have also been implemented. In its current form, temporal properties are specified in the alternation-free fragment of the modal mu-calculus [Koz83], and system models are specified in XL, a value-passing language based on CCS. The core computational components of the XMC system, such as those for compiling the specification language, model checking, etc., are built on top of the XSB tabled logic-programming system.},
