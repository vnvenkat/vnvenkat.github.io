abstract: XMC is a toolset for specifying and verifying concurrent systems. Its main
  mode of verification is temporal-logic model checking, although equivalence checkers
  have also been implemented. In its current form, temporal properties are specified
  in the alternation-free fragment of the modal mu-calculus [Koz83], and system models
  are specified in XL, a value-passing language based on CCS. The core computational
  components of the XMC system, such as those for compiling the specification language,
  model checking, etc., are built on top of the XSB tabled logic-programming system.
