 abstract = {A well-known tenet for ensuring unauthorized leaks of sensitive data such as passwords and cryptographic keys is to erase (''zeroize'') them after their intended use in any
program. Prior work on minimizing sensitive data lifetimes has focused exclusively on
sequential programs. In this work, we address the problem of data lifetime minimization
for concurrent programs. We develop a new algorithm that precisely anticipates when
to introduce these erasures, and develop an implementation of this algorithm in a tool
called DEICS. Through an experimental evaluation, we show that DEICS is able to
reduce lifetimes of shared sensitive data in several concurrent applications (over 100k
lines of code combined) with minimal performance overheads.},
