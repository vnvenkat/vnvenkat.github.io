 abstract = {Organized cybercrime on the Internet is proliferating due to exploit kits. Attacks launched through these kits include drive-bydownloads, spam and denial-of-service. In this paper, we tackle
the problem of detecting whether a given URL is hosted by an exploit kit. Through an extensive analysis of the workflows of about
40 different exploit kits, we develop an approach that uses machine
learning to detect whether a given URL is hosting an exploit kit.
Central to our approach is the design of distinguishing features that
are drawn from the analysis of attack-centric and self-defense behaviors of exploit kits. This design is based on observations drawn
from exploit kits that we installed in a laboratory setting as well as
live exploit kits that were hosted on the Web. We discuss the design and implementation of a system called WEBWINNOW that is
based on this approach. Extensive experiments with real world malicious URLs reveal that WEBWINNOW is highly effective in the
detection of malicious URLs hosted by exploit kits with very low
false-positives.},
