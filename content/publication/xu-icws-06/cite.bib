 abstract = {The rapid growth of web applications has prompted increasing interest in the area of composite web services that involve several service providers. The potential for such composite web services can be realized only if consumer privacy concerns are satisfactorily addressed. In this paper, we propose a framework that addresses consumer privacy concerns in the context of highly customizable composite web services. Our approach involves service producers exchanging their terms-of-use with consumers in the form of "models". Our framework provides automated techniques for checking these models at the consumer site for compliance of consumer privacy policies. In the event of a policy violation, our framework supports automatic generation of "obligations" that the consumer generates for the composite service. These obligations are automatically enforced through a dynamic program analysis approach on the web service composition code. We illustrate our approach with the implementation of two example services.},
