abstract: The rapid growth of web applications has prompted increasing interest in
  the area of composite web services that involve several service providers. The potential
  for such composite web services can be realized only if consumer privacy concerns
  are satisfactorily addressed. In this paper, we propose a framework that addresses
  consumer privacy concerns in the context of highly customizable composite web services.
  Our approach involves service producers exchanging their terms-of-use with consumers
  in the form of \"models\". Our framework provides automated techniques for checking
  these models at the consumer site for compliance of consumer privacy policies. In
  the event of a policy violation, our framework supports automatic generation of
  \"obligations\" that the consumer generates for the composite service. These obligations
  are automatically enforced through a dynamic program analysis approach on the web
  service composition code. We illustrate our approach with the implementation of
  two example services.
