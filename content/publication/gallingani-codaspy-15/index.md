abstract: Android's Inter-Component Communication (ICC) mechanism strongly relies
  on Intent messages. Unfortunately, due to the lack of message origin verification
  in Intents, application security completely relies on the programmer's skill and
  attention. In this paper, we advance the state of the art by developing a method
  to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities and, most importantly, demonstrate
  whether they can be exploited or not. To this end, we adopt a formal approach to
  automatically produce malicious payloads that can trigger dangerous behavior in
  vulnerable applications. We test our methods on a representative sample of applications,
  and we find that 29 out of 64 tested applications are potentially vulnerable, while
  26 of them are automatically proven to be exploitable.
