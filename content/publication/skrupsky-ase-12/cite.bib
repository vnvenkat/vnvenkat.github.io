 abstract = {The current practice of web application development treats the client and server components of the application as two separate but interacting pieces
of software. Each component is written independently, usually in distinct programming languages
and development platforms --- a process known to
be prone to errors when the client and server share
application logic. When the client and server are
out of sync, an ``impedance mismatch'' occurs, often
leading to software vulnerabilities as demonstrated
by recent work on parameter tampering. This paper
outlines the groundwork for a new software development approach, WAVES, where developers author
the server-side application logic and rely on tools
to automatically synthesize the corresponding clientside application logic. WAVES employs program
analysis techniques to extract a logical specification
from the server, from which it synthesizes client code.
WAVES also synthesizes interactive client interfaces
that include asynchronous callbacks whose performance and coverage rival that of manually written
clients while ensuring no new security vulnerabilities are introduced. The effectiveness of WAVES is
demonstrated and evaluated on three real-world web
applications.},
