 abstract = {We present the first sound program transformation approach for automatically transforming the code of a legacy web application to employ PREPARE statements in place of unsafe SQL queries. Our approach therefore opens the way for eradicating the SQL injection threat vector from legacy web applications. This extended abstract is based on our paper[4] that appeared in the Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC'2010) conference.},
