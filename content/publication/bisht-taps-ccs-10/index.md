abstract: We present the first sound program transformation approach for automatically
  transforming the code of a legacy web application to employ PREPARE statements in
  place of unsafe SQL queries. Our approach therefore opens the way for eradicating
  the SQL injection threat vector from legacy web applications. This extended abstract
  is based on our paper[4] that appeared in the Financial Cryptography and Data Security
  (FC'2010) conference.
